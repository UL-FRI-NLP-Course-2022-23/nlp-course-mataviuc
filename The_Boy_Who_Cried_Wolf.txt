Once upon a time, there was a shepherd boy who was bored while watching the sheep. To have some fun, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" even though there was no wolf around. The villagers came running to help, but they found out that the boy had lied. The boy laughed at them and did the same thing again a few days later. Again, the villagers came running to help, but they found no wolf. Finally, a few days later, a real wolf came and the boy shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" The villagers didn't believe him anymore and didn't come to help. The wolf ate all the sheep, and the boy learned his lesson.
