## Description
This is repository for course NLP. We have chosen the first project, namely literacy situation models knowledge base creation.

Literature is a rich and diverse field that contains a vast set of characters and relationships. From novels and short stories to plays and poems, literature offers an endless variety of human experiences, emotions, and perspectives. We established and implemented a method for database enrichment, meaning extracting NER, adding relationships, and sentiment character analysis (protagonists, antagonists).

## Project structure
* Folder [data](data/) contains our fairy tale corpus.
* [Notebook](corpus_analysis.ipynb) contains basic corpus analysis.
