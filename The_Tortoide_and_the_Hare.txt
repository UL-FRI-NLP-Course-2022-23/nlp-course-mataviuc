Once upon a time, a hare challenged a tortoise to a race. The tortoise, being slow and steady, accepted the challenge. The race began, and the hare quickly took the lead. Feeling confident in his ability to win, the hare decided to take a nap. Meanwhile, the tortoise continued on at his slow and steady pace. When the hare woke up, he realized that the tortoise was close to the finish line. He started running as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise crossed the finish line first, winning the race.
