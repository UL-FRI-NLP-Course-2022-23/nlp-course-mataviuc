0,THE GOLDEN BIRD,"A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.’ Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too. Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner. Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind. When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind. Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage. But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his own. So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair, when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’ Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind. All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’ said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own. Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again. As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again. Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess. Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man, ‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’ ‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as fast as you can.’ All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away.’ This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows, and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’ thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’ He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any way be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were given up, and went on with him towards their home. And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said, ‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went home to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept. The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to his kingdom. A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the princess, who had been lost a great many many years.","A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in a beautiful garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. golden apples were always counted, and about the time when golden apples began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of golden apples was gone.

However, at last it was agreed the youngest son should go, for the youngest son would not rest at home; and as the youngest son came to a wood, the youngest son met a fox, and heard the good advice.

All went right, and the groom fast asleep and snoring lay snoring with the groom fast asleep and snoring's hand upon the old leathern saddle. But when the youngest son looked at the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind, the youngest son thought it a great pity to put the old leathern saddle upon the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind. ‘the youngest son will give the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind the old leathern saddle,’ said the youngest son; ‘the youngest son am sure the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind deserves the old leathern saddle.’ As the youngest son took up the old leathern saddle awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took the groom fast asleep and snoring prisoner, and in the morning the groom fast asleep and snoring was again brought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if the groom fast asleep and snoring could bring thither a bird, the groom fast asleep and snoring should live, and have a bird and the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind given the groom fast asleep and snoring for the groom fast asleep and snoring's own. Then the groom fast asleep and snoring went the groom fast asleep and snoring's way very sorrowful; but a fox came and said, ‘Why did not the groom fast asleep and snoring listen to a fox? If the groom fast asleep and snoring had, the groom fast asleep and snoring would have carried away the bird and the horse; yet will a fox once more give the groom fast asleep and snoring counsel. Go straight on, and in the evening the groom fast asleep and snoring will arrive at a castle. At twelve o’clock at night a bird goes to the bathing-house: go up to a bird and give a bird a kiss, and a bird will let the groom fast asleep and snoring lead a bird away; but take care the groom fast asleep and snoring do not suffer a bird to go and take leave of a bird's father and mother.’ Then a fox stretched out my tail, and so away they went over stock and stone till they's hair whistled again. As they came to a castle, all was as a fox had said, and at twelve o’clock at night the youngest son met the princess going to the bathing-house and gave the princess going to the bath a kiss, and a bird agreed to run away with the youngest son, but begged with many tears that the youngest son would let a bird take leave of his father. At first the youngest son refused, but a bird wept still more and more, and fell at the youngest son's feet, till at last the youngest son consented; but the moment a bird came to his father house the guards awoke and the youngest son was taken prisoner again. Then the youngest son was brought before A certain king, and A certain king said, ‘the youngest son shall never have a bird unless in eight days the youngest son dig away the hill that stops the view from A certain king's window.’ Now the hill that stops the view from my window was so big that the whole world could not take the hill that stops the view from my window away: and when the youngest son had worked for seven days, and had done very little, a fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; a fox will work for the youngest son.’ And in the morning the youngest son awoke and the hill that stops the view from my window was gone; so a fox went merrily to A certain king, and told A certain king that now that the hill that stops the view from my window was removed A certain king must give A certain king a bird.

When the youngest son come to A certain king, and A certain king asks for a bird, the youngest son must say, “Here a bird is!” Then A certain king will be very joyful; and the youngest son will mount the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind, and put out the youngest son's hand to take leave of they; but shake hands with a bird last.

Then a fox came, and said, ‘Pray kill a fox, and cut off a fox's head and his feet.’ But the youngest son refused to do cut: so a fox said, ‘a fox will at any rate give the youngest son good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows, and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away a fox went. ‘Well,’ thought the youngest son, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’ the youngest son rode on with a bird, till at last the youngest son came to the village where the youngest son had left the youngest son's two brothers.

Then the youngest son did not stay to think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his two brothers were given up, and went on with the youngest son towards the rascals's home. And as the rascals came to the wood where a fox first met the rascals, the wood where the fox first met them was so cool and pleasant that Two men said, ‘Let the rascals sit down by the side of the wood, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So the youngest son said, ‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the woodthe river; and while the youngest son suspected nothing, Two men came behind, and threw the youngest son down the bank, and took a bird, the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind, and a bird, and went home to A certain kingTwo men's , and said. ‘All this have Two men won by Two men's labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind would not eat, a bird would not sing, and a bird wept. the youngest son fell to the bottom of the river's bed: luckily the river’s bed was nearly dry, but the youngest son's bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep that the youngest son could find no way to get out.

And at last a fox did so, and in a moment a fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of a bird.","[[[4, 6], [10, 11]], [[17, 18], [20, 21], [31, 31], [44, 44], [92, 93], [203,

1,HANS IN LUCK,"Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it know about the matter? One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had worked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head. Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say of making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse, and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’ However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry “Jip!”’ Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,  ‘No care and no sorrow,   A fig for the morrow!   We’ll laugh and be merry,   Sing neigh down derry!’ After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break his neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day, into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said the shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man has!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away he rode. Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that. While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said Hans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said the butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’ said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg. So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all. How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got? The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The countryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a christening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he, ‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’ Poor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born; but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’ thought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’ As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel, working and singing,  ‘O’er hill and o’er dale   So happy I roam,   Work light and live well,   All the world is my home;   Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’ Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the other, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where did you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a horse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my head for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long years.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder, ‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand in it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be managed?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other; ‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the value of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said Hans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s the goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone that lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’ Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself. People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’ Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow. At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream. For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone. ‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.","Some men are born to good luck: all Some men do or try to do comes right--all that falls to Some men is so much gain--all Some men's geese are swans--all Some men's cards are trumps--toss Some men which way you will, Some men will always, like poor puss, alight upon Some men's legs, and only move on so much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of Some men as Some men think of Some men, but what care Some men for The world? what can The world know about the matter? One of Some men was neighbour Hans. Seven long years neighbour Hans had worked hard for neighbour Hans's master. At last neighbour Hans said, ‘his master, neighbour Hans's time is up; neighbour Hans must go home and see neighbour Hans's poor mother once more: so pray pay neighbour Hans neighbour Hans's wages and let neighbour Hans go.’ And his master said, ‘neighbour Hans have been a faithful and good servant, neighbour Hans, so my wages shall be handsome.’ Then his master gave neighbour Hans a lump of silver as big as neighbour Hans's head. neighbour Hans took out neighbour Hans's pocket-handkerchief, put a lump of silver as big as his head into his pocket-handkerchief, threw his pocket-handkerchief over neighbour Hans's shoulder, and jogged off on neighbour Hans's road homewards. As neighbour Hans went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said neighbour Hans aloud, ‘what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There a man sits as easy and happy as if a man was at home, in the chair by a man's fireside; a man trips against no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on a man hardly knows how.’ neighbour Hans did not speak so softly but a man heard it all, and said, ‘Well, neighbour Hans, why do neighbour Hans go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said neighbour Hans, ‘neighbour Hans have this load to carry: to be sure this load to carry is silver, but this load to carry is so heavy that neighbour Hans can’t hold up neighbour Hans's head, and a man must know this load to carry hurts neighbour Hans's shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do neighbour Hans say of making an exchange?’ said a man. ‘a man will give neighbour Hans a capital horse, and neighbour Hans shall give a man this load to carry; which will save neighbour Hans a great deal of trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with neighbour Hans.’ ‘With all neighbour Hans's heart,’ said neighbour Hans: ‘but as a man are so kind to neighbour Hans, neighbour Hans must tell a man one thing--a man will have a weary task to draw this load to carry about with neighbour Hans.’ However, a man got off, took this load to carry, helped neighbour Hans up, gave neighbour Hans the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When neighbour Hans want to go very fast, smack neighbour Hans's lips loudly together, and cry “Jip!”’ neighbour Hans was delighted as neighbour Hans sat on a capital horse, drew neighbour Hans up, squared neighbour Hans's elbows, turned out neighbour Hans's toes, cracked the whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,  ‘No care and no sorrow,   A fig for the morrow!   We’ll laugh and be merry,   Sing neigh down derry!’ After a time neighbour Hans thought neighbour Hans should like to go a little faster, so neighbour Hans smacked neighbour Hans's lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went a capital horse full gallop; and before neighbour Hans knew what neighbour Hans was about, neighbour Hans was thrown off, and lay on neighbour Hans's back by the road-side. a capital horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped a capital horse. neighbour Hans soon came to neighbour Hans, and got upon neighbour Hans's legs again, sadly vexed, and said to a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings a man off as if a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break his neck would break a man's neck. However, neighbour Hans’m off now once for all: neighbour Hans like a cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played neighbour Hans this trick, and has spoiled neighbour Hans's best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind a cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day, into the bargain. What would neighbour Hans give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, ‘if neighbour Hans are so fond of a cow, a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow will change a cow for neighbour Hans's horse; a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow like to do good to a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow's neighbours, even though a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow lose by it a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow.’ ‘Done!’ said neighbour Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow has!’ thought neighbour Hans. Then a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow jumped upon a capital horse, wished neighbour Hans and a cow good morning, and away a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow rode. neighbour Hans brushed my best coat, wiped neighbour Hans's face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off a cow quietly, and thought neighbour Hans's bargain a very lucky one. ‘If neighbour Hans have only a piece of bread (and neighbour Hans certainly shall always be able to get only a piece of bread), neighbour Hans can, whenever neighbour Hans like, eat neighbour Hans's butter and cheese with only a piece of bread; and when neighbour Hans am thirsty neighbour Hans can milk a cow and drink the milk: and what can neighbour Hans wish for more?’ When neighbour Hans came to an inn, neighbour Hans halted, ate up all neighbour Hans's bread, and gave away neighbour Hans's last penny for a glass of beer. When neighbour Hans had rested neighbour Hans neighbour Hans set off again, driving a cow towards neighbour Hans's mother’s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as neighbour Hans found neighbour Hans on a wide heath that would take neighbour Hans more than an hour to cross, neighbour Hans began to be so hot and parched that neighbour Hans's tongue clave to the roof of neighbour Hans's mouth. ‘neighbour Hans can find a cure for this,’ thought neighbour Hans; ‘now neighbour Hans will milk a cow and quench neighbour Hans's thirst’: so neighbour Hans tied a cow to the stump of a tree, and held neighbour Hans's leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought that a cow, was all that time utterly dry? neighbour Hans had not thought of looking to was. While neighbour Hans was trying neighbour Hans's luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, a cow began to think neighbour Hans very troublesome; and at last gave neighbour Hans such a kick on the head as knocked neighbour Hans down; and there neighbour Hans lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with neighbour Hans, a butcher's ?’ said a butcher, as a butcher helped neighbour Hans up. neighbour Hans told a butcher what had happened, how neighbour Hans was dry, and wanted to milk a cow, but found a cow was dry too. Then a butcher gave neighbour Hans a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh neighbour Hans; a cow will give neighbour Hans no milk: don’t neighbour Hans see a cow is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said neighbour Hans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take a capital horse, and give neighbour Hans a cow! If neighbour Hans kill a cow, what will a cow be good for? neighbour Hans hate cow-beef; a cow is not tender enough for neighbour Hans. If a cow were a pig now--like that fat gentleman a butcher are driving along at that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease's ease--one could do something with a cow; a cow would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said a butcher, ‘a butcher don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please neighbour Hans a butcher will change, and give neighbour Hans a butcher's for a cow.’ ‘Heaven reward a butcher for a butcher's kindness and self-denial!’ said neighbour Hans, as neighbour Hans gave a butcher a cow; and taking a cow off a wheelbarrow, drove a cow away, holding a cow by the string that was tied to a cow's leg. So on neighbour Hans jogged, and all seemed now to go right with neighbour Hans: neighbour Hans had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but neighbour Hans was now well repaid for all. How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as neighbour Hans had at last got? The next man neighbour Hans met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. a countryman carrying a fine white goose stopped to ask what was o’clock; ask led to further chat; and neighbour Hans told a countryman carrying a fine white goose all neighbour Hans's luck, how neighbour Hans had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with neighbour Hans. a countryman carrying a fine white goose then began to tell a countryman carrying a fine white goose's tale, and said a countryman carrying a fine white goose was going to take a fine white goose to a christening. ‘Feel,’ said a countryman carrying a fine white goose, ‘how heavy a fine white goose is, and yet a fine white goose is only eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats a fine white goose will find plenty of fat upon a fine white goose, a fine white goose has lived so well!’ ‘a countryman carrying a fine white goose’re right,’ said neighbour Hans, as neighbour Hans weighed a fine white goose in neighbour Hans's hand; ‘but if a countryman carrying a fine white goose talk of fat, your horse is no trifle.’ Meantime a countryman carrying a fine white goose began to look grave, and shook a countryman carrying a fine white goose's head. ‘Hark ye!’ said a countryman carrying a fine white goose, ‘a countryman carrying a fine white goose's , neighbour Hans seem a good sort of fellow, so a countryman carrying a fine white goose can’t help doing neighbour Hans a kind turn. your horse may get neighbour Hans into a scrape. In the village a countryman carrying a fine white goose just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of the squire's sty. a countryman carrying a fine white goose was dreadfully afraid when a countryman carrying a fine white goose saw neighbour Hans that neighbour Hans had got a pig. If neighbour Hans have, and they catch neighbour Hans, it will be a bad job for neighbour Hans. The least they will do will be to throw neighbour Hans into the horse-pond. Can neighbour Hans swim?’ neighbour Hans was sadly frightened. ‘a countryman carrying a fine white goose,’ cried neighbour Hans, ‘pray get neighbour Hans out of this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay. neighbour Hans know nothing of where a cow was either bred or born; but a cow may have been the squire for aught neighbour Hans can tell: a countryman carrying a fine white goose know this country better than neighbour Hans do, take your horse and give neighbour Hans a fine white goose.’ ‘a countryman carrying a fine white goose ought to have something into the bargain,’ said a countryman carrying a fine white goose; ‘give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for neighbour Hans as give. However, a countryman carrying a fine white goose will not be hard upon neighbour Hans, as neighbour Hans are in trouble.’ Then a countryman carrying a fine white goose took the string in a countryman carrying a fine white goose's hand, and drove off a cow by a side path; while neighbour Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’ thought neighbour Hans, ‘a cow is pretty well taken in. neighbour Hans don’t care whose pig a cow is, but wherever a cow came from a cow has been a very good friend to neighbour Hans. neighbour Hans have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find neighbour Hans in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers. neighbour Hans will put all the beautiful white feathers into neighbour Hans's pillow, and then neighbour Hans am sure neighbour Hans shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my poor mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give neighbour Hans a fine fat goose.’ As neighbour Hans came to the next village, neighbour Hans saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel, working and singing,  ‘O’er hill and o’er dale   So happy his roam,   Work light and live well,   All the world is his's home;   Then who so blythe, so merry as his?’ neighbour Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘his must be well off, his! his seem so happy at his's work.’ ‘Yes,’ said his, ‘his is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts a good grinder's hand into a good grinder's pocket without finding money in his pocket--but where did neighbour Hans get a fine white goose?’ ‘neighbour Hans did not buy a fine white goose, neighbour Hans gave your horse for a fine white goose.’ ‘And where did neighbour Hans get your horse?’ ‘neighbour Hans gave a cow for your horse.’ ‘And a cow?’ ‘neighbour Hans gave a horse for a cow.’ ‘And a horse?’ ‘neighbour Hans gave a lump of silver as big as my head for a horse.’ ‘And this load to carry?’ ‘Oh! neighbour Hans worked hard for that seven long years.’ ‘neighbour Hans have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said his, ‘now if neighbour Hans could find money in neighbour Hans's pocket whenever neighbour Hans put neighbour Hans's hand in your pocket, neighbour Hans's fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be managed?’ ‘How? Why, neighbour Hans must turn grinder like his,’ said his; ‘neighbour Hans only want a grindstone; the rest will come of the rest. Here is one that is but little the worse for wear: his would not ask more than the value of a fine white goose for one that is but little the worse for wear--will neighbour Hans buy?’ ‘How can his ask?’ said neighbour Hans; ‘neighbour Hans should be the happiest man in the world, if neighbour Hans could have money whenever neighbour Hans put neighbour Hans's hand in your pocket: what could neighbour Hans want more? there’s a fine white goose.’ ‘Now,’ said a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, as a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow gave neighbour Hans a common rough stone that lay by a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow's side, ‘a common rough stone that lay by his side is a most capital stone; do but work a common rough stone that lay by his side well enough, and neighbour Hans can make an old nail cut with a common rough stone that lay by his side.’ neighbour Hans took a common rough stone that lay by his side, and went neighbour Hans's way with a light heart: neighbour Hans's eyes sparkled for joy, and neighbour Hans said to neighbour Hans, ‘Surely neighbour Hans must have been born in a lucky hour; everything neighbour Hans could want or wish for comes of everything I could want or wish for. People are so kind; People seem really to think neighbour Hans do People a favour in letting People make neighbour Hans rich, and giving neighbour Hans good bargains.’ Meantime neighbour Hans began to be tired, and hungry too, for neighbour Hans had given away neighbour Hans's last penny in neighbour Hans's joy at getting a cow. At last neighbour Hans could go no farther, for a common rough stone that lay by his side tired neighbour Hans sadly: and neighbour Hans dragged neighbour Hans to the side of a river, that neighbour Hans might take a drink of water, and rest a while. So neighbour Hans laid a common rough stone that lay by his side carefully by neighbour Hans's side on the bank: but, as neighbour Hans stooped down to drink, neighbour Hans forgot a common rough stone that lay by his side, pushed a common rough stone that lay by his side a little, and down a common rough stone that lay by his side rolled, plump into the stream. For a while neighbour Hans watched a common rough stone that lay by his side sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon neighbour Hans's knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in neighbour Hans's eyes, for Heaven's kindness in taking away neighbour Hans's only plague, the ugly heavy stone. ‘How happy am neighbour Hans!’ cried neighbour Hans; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up neighbour Hans got with a light heart, free from all neighbour Hans's troubles, and walked on till neighbour Hans reached his mother’s house, and told his mother’s how very easy the road to good luck was.","[[[0, 1], [9, 9], [22, 22], [29, 29], [35, 35], [41, 41], [47, 47], [57, 57], [78, 78], [80, 80], [83, 83], [88, 88], [103, 105]], [[69, 70], [90, 91], [95,

2,JORINDA AND JORINDEL,"There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them. Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches. Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take. The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,  ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,   Well-a-day! Well-a-day!   He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,   Well-a-day!’ when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them, and three times screamed:  ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’ Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another. She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice:  ‘Till the prisoner is fast,   And her doom is cast,   There stay! Oh, stay!   When the charm is around her,   And the spell has bound her,   Hie away! away!’ On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way. He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda. At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again. In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle. He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood. Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.","There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood lived an old fairy. Now an old fairy could take any shape an old fairy pleased. All the day long an old fairy flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night an old fairy always became an old woman again.

There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and all with beautiful birds in these cages.

At last an old fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice:  ‘Till the prisoner is fast,   And the prisoner's doom is cast,   There stay! Oh, stay!   When the charm is around the prisoner,   And the spell has bound the prisoner,   Hie away! away!’ On a sudden a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel found a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel free. Then a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel fell on a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel's knees before an old fairy, and prayed an old fairy to give a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel back a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel's : but an old fairy laughed at a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, and said a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel should never see a maiden whose name was Jorinda again; then an old fairy went an old fairy's way. a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel prayed, a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel wept, a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel said, ‘what will become of a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel?’ a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel could not go back to a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel's own home, so a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel went to a strange village, and employed a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel in keeping sheep.

While a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel was thinking what to do, a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel saw an old fairy had taken down one of the seven hundred cages, and was making the best of an old fairy's way off through the door. a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel ran or flew after an old fairy, touched one of the cages with a beautiful purple flower, and a maiden whose name was Jorinda stood before a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, and threw a maiden whose name was Jorinda's arms round a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel's neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in a deep gloomy wood. Then a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel touched all the other birds with a beautiful purple flower, so that all the other birds took all the other birds's old forms again; and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel took a maiden whose name was Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the seven hundred cages by a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked, much longer than a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked liked.","[[[3, 16], [20, 21], [81, 82], [154, 155], [166, 167], [259, 262], [425, 426], [851, 853], [915, 916], [1024, 1025], [1035, 1035]], [[23, 25], [28, 29], [34, 34], [41, 41], [63, 63], [81, 81], [96, 96], [104, 104], [112, 112], [138, 139], [259, 261], [603, 605], [627, 627], [631, 631], [643, 643], [678, 679], [750, 751], [755, 755], [765, 765], [780, 780], [782, 782], [1110, 1111], [1127, 1127], [1130, 1130], [1141, 1141], [1202, 1203], [1218, 1218], [1230, 1230], [1325, 1328]], [[72, 74], [84, 84], [100, 100], [109, 109], [113, 113]], [[123, 125], [130, 130], [141, 141], [148, 148]], [[162, 163], [175, 175]], [[181, 186], [188, 188], [216, 216], [304, 304], [316, 316], [440, 440], [477, 479], [490, 490], [504, 505], [513, 513], [760, 762], [776, 776], [870, 870], [933, 934], [1189, 1190], [1240, 1240], [1247, 1247], [1293, 1293]], [[219, 219], [228, 228], [237, 237], [247, 247], [252, 252], [320, 320], [324, 324], [334, 334], [345, 345], [354, 354], [360, 360], [365, 365], [367, 367], [410, 410], [534, 534], [1262, 1262], [1297, 1297]], [[13, 16], [233, 234], [1266, 1267]], [[203, 210], [243, 243], [313, 313], [396, 396], [402, 402], [429, 429], [471, 471], [477, 477], [495, 495], [504, 504], [553, 553], [558, 558], [646, 647], [657, 657], [660, 660], [665, 665], [673, 673], [738, 738], [740, 740], [744, 744], [747, 747], [758, 758], [760, 760], [768, 768], [772, 772], [785, 785], [788, 788], [791, 791], [803, 803], [811, 811], [814, 814], [820, 820], [825, 825], [834, 834], [843, 843], [855, 855], [864, 864], [874, 874], [879, 879], [899, 899], [902, 902], [912, 912], [921, 921], [931, 931], [933, 933], [941, 941], [944, 944], [961, 961], [979, 979], [1005, 1005], [1020, 1020], [1027, 1027], [1039, 1039], [1050, 1050], [1060, 1060], [1070, 1070], [1085, 1085], [1095, 1095], [1104, 1104], [1129, 1129], [1149, 1149], [1154, 1154], [1157, 1157], [1160, 1160], [1163, 1163], [1184, 1184], [1189, 1189], [1193, 1193], [1200, 1200], [1225, 1225], [1243, 1243], [1250, 1250], [1270, 1270], [1291, 1291]], [[275, 277], [310, 311], [378, 379], [388, 388], [581, 582]], [[490, 491], [513, 514]], [[525, 529], [592, 593]], [[508, 509], [634, 635], [641, 641], [649, 650]], [[692, 693], [699, 699], [718, 718], [726, 726]], [[881, 884], [892, 892], [904, 905], [910, 910], [924, 924], [953, 955], [964, 964], [981, 984], [991, 991], [1007, 1008], [1075, 1076], [1152, 1158], [1236, 1237], [1277, 1278]], [[1057, 1058], [1067, 1067], [1072, 1073], [1079, 1079], [1222, 1223]], [[912, 913], [1157, 1158]], [[1115, 1118], [1167, 1168]], [[1121, 1124], [1209, 1210], [1325, 1329]], [[1207, 1210], [1233, 1234]], [[1272, 1275], [1282, 1283], [1285, 1285]], [[1311, 1337], [1331, 1331], [1336, 1336]]]"
3,THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS,"An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’ After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my friend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on together. They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass, ‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’ said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’ ‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party. Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main. ‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together. They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived. The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and peeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What do I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them, and scampered away as fast as they could. The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep. But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, ‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.","An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to An honest farmer a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work. an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work's therefore was tired of keeping an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work and began to think of putting an end to an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work; but the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind slyly off, and began the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind's journey towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, ‘the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind may turn musician.’ After the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind had travelled a little way, the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind spied a dog lying by the roadside and panting as if a dog were tired. ‘What makes a dog pant so, a dog?’ said the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind. ‘Alas!’ said a dog, ‘a dog's was going to knock a dog on the head, because a dog am old and weak, and can no longer make a dog useful to An honest farmer in hunting; so a dog ran away; but what can a dog do to earn a dog's livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, ‘the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind am going to the great city to turn musician: suppose a dog go with the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, and try what a dog can do in the same way?’ a dog said a dog was willing, and they jogged on together. they had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, a cat,’ said the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, ‘what’s the matter with a cat? a cat look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, a cat!’ said a cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in danger? Because a cat am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at a cat's ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, a cat's mistress laid hold of a cat, and was going to drown a cat; and though a cat have been lucky enough to get away from my mistress, a cat do not know what a cat am to live upon.’ ‘Oh,’ said the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, ‘by all means go with they to the great city; a cat are a good night singer, and may make a cat's fortune as a musician.’ a cat was pleased with the thought, and joined they.

At this one of them, who was bolder than the rest ran back as fast as one of them, who was bolder than the rest could to one of them, who was bolder than the rest's comrades, and told the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at one of them, who was bolder than the rest and scratched one of them, who was bolder than the rest's face with a horrid witch's long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in a man with a knife in his hand's hand had hidden a man with a knife in his hand behind the door, and stabbed one of them, who was bolder than the rest in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck one of them, who was bolder than the rest with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, ‘Throw one of them, who was bolder than the rest up here!’ After this they all four never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with the musicians's quarters that the musicians took up the musicians's abode there; and there the musicians are, the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind dare say, at this very day.","[[[0, 2], [14, 14], [35, 36], [145, 146], [171, 171]], [[5, 33], [35, 35], [42, 42], [52, 52]], [[55, 66], [69, 69], [75, 75], [88, 88], [91, 91], [98, 98], [105, 105], [128, 128], [133, 134], [197, 198], [201, 201], [216, 216], [270, 270], [276, 277], [392, 393], [472, 473], [477, 477], [565, 566], [672, 673], [794, 795], [888, 897], [910, 910], [919, 919], [926, 926], [931, 932], [937, 937], [970, 971], [978, 979], [1013, 1014], [1016, 1016], [1019, 1019], [1024, 1024], [1035, 1035], [1049, 1050], [1076, 1077], [1089, 1090], [1224, 1225], [1227, 1227], [1263, 1264], [1462, 1463], [1502, 1503], [1626, 1626]], [[107, 108], [117, 117], [124, 124], [128, 129], [141, 142], [145, 145], [151, 151], [157, 157], [168, 168], [176, 176], [183, 183], [187, 187], [213, 213], [221, 221], [230, 231], [233, 233], [675, 676], [822, 823], [826, 826], [1031, 1032], [1043, 1045], [1080, 1081], [1238, 1239], [1241, 1241], [1443, 1444]], [[78, 80], [205, 207], [403, 405], [651, 653]], [[238, 238], [243, 243], [249, 249], [401, 401], [434, 435], [441, 441], [448, 448], [509, 509], [515, 515], [571, 571], [600, 600], [607, 607], [621, 621], [798, 798], [802, 802], [806, 806], [846, 846], [862, 862], [872, 872], [895, 896], [966, 966], [983, 983], [991, 991], [995, 995], [1007, 1007], [1071, 1071], [1073, 1073]], [[251, 252], [270, 272], [285, 285], [287, 287], [298, 298], [302, 303], [322, 322], [334, 334], [348, 348], [353, 353], [360, 360], [364, 364], [375, 375], [380, 380], [407, 407], [417, 417], [424, 425], [686, 687], [1038, 1039], [1056, 1058], [1084, 1085], [1249, 1250], [1252, 1252], [1385, 1386], [1406, 1407]], [[348, 349], [373, 373], [522, 523]], [[450, 451], [462, 462], [480, 480], [499, 500], [503, 503], [522, 522], [530, 530], [532, 532], [540, 540], [548, 548], [572, 573], [589, 589], [627, 627], [632, 633], [695, 696], [702, 702], [706, 706], [725, 725], [729, 729], [740, 740], [752, 752], [763, 763], [779, 779], [854, 854], [914, 914]], [[540, 541], [589, 590]], [[636, 638], [644, 644], [664, 664], [1095, 1096], [1165, 1166], [1184, 1184], [1198, 1198], [1201, 1201], [1203, 1203], [1279, 1279], [1285, 1285], [1288, 1288], [1298, 1299], [1314, 1314], [1319, 1319], [1334, 1334], [1593, 1594]], [[672, 676], [678, 678], [763, 764]], [[681, 683], [717, 718]], [[734, 734], [750, 750]], [[770, 770], [787, 787]], [[781, 782], [857, 858], [865, 865]], [[939, 947], [953, 953]], [[901, 902], [1028, 1029], [1099, 1100]], [[1000, 1001], [1122, 1135], [1149, 1149], [1157, 1157], [1173, 1174]], [[1210, 1210], [1220, 1220]], [[1206, 1207], [1304, 1305]], [[1332, 1341], [1355, 1355], [1365, 1365], [1388, 1388], [1416, 1416], [1425, 1425], [1429, 1429], [1434, 1434], [1449, 1449], [1456, 1456], [1465, 1465], [1487, 1488], [1494, 1494], [1497, 1497], [1518, 1518], [1521, 1521], [1547, 1547], [1562, 1562], [1585, 1586]], [[1380, 1386], [1390, 1390], [1400, 1400]], [[1367, 1368], [1397, 1398]], [[1373, 1374], [1403, 1403]], [[1468, 1477], [1482, 1482]], [[1273, 1274], [1511, 1512], [1577, 1578], [1601, 1602]], [[1505, 1507], [1524, 1524]], [[1530, 1537], [1536, 1536], [1540, 1540]], [[1460, 1461], [1558, 1559]], [[1605, 1606], [1611, 1611], [1614, 1614], [1617, 1617], [1623, 1623]]]"
4,OLD SULTAN,"A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’ Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master, you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he could wish for. Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’ said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely. Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air. The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.","A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's teeth. And one day when A shepherd and A shepherd's wife were standing together before the house A shepherd said, ‘A shepherd will shoot a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth tomorrow morning, for a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth is of no use now.’ But his wife said, ‘Pray let a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth live; a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth has served the shepherd and his wife well a great many years, and the shepherd and his wife ought to give a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth a livelihood for the rest of a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's days.’ ‘But what can the shepherd and his wife do with a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth?’ said A shepherd, ‘a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth has not a tooth in a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's head, and the thieves don’t care for a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth at all; to be sure a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth has served the shepherd and his wife, but then a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth did served to earn a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's livelihood; tomorrow shall be a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's last day, depend upon be.’ Poor Sultan, who was lying close by the shepherd and his wife, heard all that the shepherd and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's last day; so in the evening a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth went to a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood all a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's sorrows, and how A shepherd meant to kill a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth in the morning. ‘Make yourself easy,’ said his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, ‘his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood will give yourself some good advice. yourself's , yourself know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the field; and they take they's little child with they, and lay their little child down behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do yourself lie down close by their little child, and pretend to be watching their little child, and his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood will come out of the wood and run away with their little child; yourself must run after his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood as fast as yourself can, and his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood will let their little child drop; then yourself may carry their little child back, and they will think yourself have saved their little child, and will be so thankful to yourself that they will take care of yourself as long as yourself live.’ a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth liked this plan very well; and accordingly so this plan was managed. a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth ran with their little child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth soon overtook a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth, and carried their little child back to they. Then A shepherd patted their little child on the head, and said, ‘a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth has saved their little child from a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth, and therefore a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. his wife, go home, and give a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth a good dinner, and let a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth have his wife's old cushion to sleep on as long as a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth lives.’ So from this time forward a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth had all that a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth could wish for. Soon afterwards a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth came and wished a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth joy, and said, ‘Now, a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth, a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth must tell no tales, but turn a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's head the other way when a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’ said a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth; ‘a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth will be true to A shepherd.’ However, a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth thought a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth had told A shepherd what a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth meant to do; so a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth laid wait for a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth behind the barn door, and when a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth had a stout cudgel laid about a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's back, that combed a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's locks for a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth finely. Then a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth was very angry, and called a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth ‘an old rogue,’ and swore a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth would have a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's revenge. So the next morning a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth sent the boar to challenge a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth had nobody a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth could ask to be a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth's second but the old shepherd’s's old three-legged cat; so a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth took the shepherd’s old three-legged cat with a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth, and as the shepherd’s old three-legged cat limped along with some trouble, the shepherd’s old three-legged cat stuck up the shepherd’s old three-legged cat's tail straight in the air. a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth and the boar were first on the ground; and when The wolf and the wild boar espied The wolf and the wild boar's enemies coming, and saw her tail standing straight in the air, The wolf and the wild boar thought the shepherd’s old three-legged cat was carrying a sword for a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth to fight with; and every time the shepherd’s old three-legged cat limped, The wolf and the wild boar thought the shepherd’s old three-legged cat was picking up a stone to throw at The wolf and the wild boar; so The wolf and the wild boar said The wolf and the wild boar should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth jumped up into a tree. The wolf and the wild boar soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there. the boar, however, had not quite hidden the boar, for the boar's ears stuck out of a bush; and when the boar shook one of his ears a little, the shepherd’s old three-legged cat, seeing something move, and thinking something was a mouse, sprang upon something, and bit and scratched something, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in a tree, there sits the one who is to blame.’ So The wolf and the wild boar looked up, and espied a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth sitting amongst the branches; and The wolf and the wild boar called the one who is to blame a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer the one who is to blame to come down till the one who is to blame was heartily ashamed of the one who is to blame, and had promised to be good friends again with a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth.","[[[3, 21], [20, 20], [46, 47], [52, 52], [68, 71], [74, 74], [89, 89], [96, 96], [107, 107], [115, 115], [121, 121], [131, 131], [138, 138], [145, 145], [150, 150], [156, 156], [198, 198], [206, 206], [209, 209], [225, 225], [230, 230], [235, 235], [390, 391], [405, 406], [424, 424], [427, 427], [437, 437], [455, 456], [462, 463], [467, 467], [490, 490], [497, 497], [508, 508], [517, 517], [521, 521], [528, 529], [533, 533], [542, 542], [542, 544], [546, 546], [554, 554], [560, 560], [580, 581], [584, 584], [589, 589], [595, 596], [598, 598], [614, 614], [617, 617], [620, 621], [627, 627], [631, 631], [639, 640], [651, 651], [658, 658], [663, 663], [666, 666], [670, 671], [678, 678], [687, 687], [690, 690], [697, 698], [704, 704], [716, 716], [719, 719], [724, 724], [737, 737], [741, 741], [764, 765], [805, 805], [851, 852], [859, 859], [972, 973], [1012, 1013]], [[0, 1], [27, 28], [30, 30], [38, 39], [43, 43], [61, 61], [111, 112], [178, 179], [181, 181], [230, 231], [259, 260], [272, 272], [415, 416], [418, 418], [443, 444], [589, 590], [617, 618]], [[30, 31], [61, 62], [181, 182], [272, 273], [418, 419], [483, 483], [499, 499]], [[27, 31], [77, 77], [85, 85], [104, 104], [141, 141], [173, 173], [178, 182], [415, 419], [459, 459]], [[140, 140], [147, 147]], [[155, 155], [162, 162]], [[153, 153], [195, 195]], [[209, 219], [223, 223], [247, 248], [251, 251], [321, 321], [338, 338], [346, 346]], [[242, 242], [254, 254], [259, 259], [262, 262], [305, 305], [334, 334], [342, 342], [353, 353], [363, 363], [375, 375], [382, 382], [386, 386]], [[279, 279], [281, 281], [285, 285], [298, 298], [360, 360], [366, 366], [377, 377], [437, 440]], [[281, 283], [289, 289], [310, 311], [318, 318], [332, 332], [349, 349], [356, 356], [366, 367], [409, 410], [431, 434], [446, 446], [459, 460]], [[218, 219], [326, 327], [708, 709]], [[393, 394], [401, 401]], [[566, 569], [727, 729]], [[727, 734], [739, 739], [745, 747], [754, 754], [757, 757], [786, 788], [799, 799], [813, 813], [818, 818], [861, 862], [908, 909]], [[700, 701], [767, 769], [842, 843], [878, 879], [887, 887], [890, 890], [900, 900], [934, 935]], [[764, 769], [778, 778], [780, 780], [797, 797], [816, 816], [827, 827], [830, 830], [832, 832], [859, 862], [966, 966], [980, 980]], [[757, 758], [786, 790]], [[847, 848], [895, 896]], [[890, 891], [904, 904]], [[912, 912], [917, 917], [924, 924], [930, 930]], [[856, 857], [952, 953]], [[957, 962], [982, 982], [991, 991], [996, 996], [1001, 1001]]]"
5,"THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN","In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’ ‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal. ‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country.’ The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.","In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook beans.

6,BRIAR ROSE,"A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off, where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world. Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall. Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years. However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew her loved her. It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the ground. However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly. A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly. After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose, lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but he was bent upon going. Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy. Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay, fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss. But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear. And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.","A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off, where there were in those days fairies.

In a little door there was a golden key, and when a daughter turned a golden key a little door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily. ‘Why, how now, an old lady,’ said a daughter; ‘what are an old lady doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said an old lady, and nodded an old lady's head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily the wheel turns round!’ said a daughter, and took the wheel and began to try and spin. But scarcely had a daughter touched the wheel, before foretold was fulfilled; the wheel wounded a daughter, and a daughter fell down lifeless on the ground. However, a daughter was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king , and all A king and queen's court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king’s dinner for the king's dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give the kitchen-boy a box on the ear for something the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss had done amiss, let the kitchen-boy go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale's lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly. A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year A large hedge of thorns became higher and thicker; till at last the palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there went a report through all the land of a daughter (for so the king's was called): so that, from time to time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through A large hedge of thorns into the palace. break, however, none of several kings’ sons could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of several kings’ sons, as it were with hands; and there several kings’ sons stuck fast, and died wretchedly. After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an old man told a king’s son the story of A large hedge of thorns; and how a beautiful palace stood behind A large hedge of thorns, and how a daughter, lay in a beautiful palace asleep, with all their court. an old man told, too, how an old man had heard from an old man's grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through A large hedge of thorns, but that many, many princes had many, many princes stuck fast in A large hedge of thorns, and died. Then a king’s son said, ‘All this shall not frighten a king’s son; a king’s son will go and see a daughter.’ an old man tried to hinder a king’s son, but a king’s son was bent upon going. Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as a king’s son came to A large hedge of thorns a king’s son saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which a king’s son went with ease, and beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he went with ease shut in after a king’s son as thick as ever. Then a king’s son came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with the pigeons's heads under the pigeons's wings. And when a king’s son came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale had the jug at the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale's lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in the maid's lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up the cook in the kitchen's hand, as if the cook in the kitchen was going to beat a king’s son. Then a king’s son went on still farther, and all was so still that a king’s son could hear every breath a king’s son drew; till at last a king’s son came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door, and opened the door of the little room in which a daughter was; and there a daughter lay, fast asleep on a couch by the window. a daughter looked so beautiful that a king’s son could not take a king’s son's eyes off a daughter, so a king’s son stooped down and gave a daughter a kiss. But the moment a king’s son kissed a daughter a daughter opened a daughter's eyes and awoke, and smiled upon a king’s son; and they went out together; and soon A king and queen also awoke, and all their court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. And the horses shook the horses, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took the pigeons's heads from under the pigeons's wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king's dinner upon the spit; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale finished the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale's draught of ale; the maid went on plucking a fowl; and the cook in the kitchen gave a king’s son the box on a king’s son's ear. And then they were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all they's lives long.","[[[0, 3], [26, 29], [65, 65], [71, 71], [79, 79], [288, 288], [304, 307], [314, 314], [320, 320], [496, 499], [698, 701], [903, 913], [917, 917], [1609, 1612]], [[72, 72], [77, 77]], [[88, 89], [106, 106], [133, 134], [171, 171], [184, 184], [189, 189], [209, 210], [268, 269], [273, 273]], [[108, 130], [116, 116], [138, 140], [144, 144], [153, 153], [156, 156], [158, 158], [168, 168], [187, 187], [198, 200]], [[96, 97], [148, 149]], [[119, 120], [162, 163]], [[171, 172], [176, 176]], [[193, 194], [212, 229], [227, 227], [245, 246], [288, 290], [386, 388], [392, 392], [405, 405], [423, 423], [518, 521], [525, 525], [584, 587], [593, 593], [618, 620], [660, 661], [680, 680], [682, 682], [692, 692], [708, 708], [717, 717], [721, 721], [735, 735], [766, 766], [796, 797], [843, 844], [860, 860], [875, 875], [878, 878], [888, 888], [1119, 1123], [1127, 1130], [1236, 1242], [1251, 1251], [1315, 1317], [1541, 1542], [1547, 1547], [1559, 1559], [1571, 1571], [1579, 1579], [1588, 1588], [1589, 1589], [1591, 1591], [1734, 1735]], [[220, 221], [233, 233], [253, 253], [255, 255], [518, 520], [584, 586], [612, 613], [618, 618], [628, 628], [903, 904], [988, 990], [1127, 1129], [1694, 1696]], [[276, 277], [281, 281], [296, 297], [327, 328], [334, 335], [373, 373], [382, 382], [419, 419], [649, 652]], [[10, 23], [299, 300], [635, 636]], [[325, 328], [331, 331], [439, 441], [450, 450], [457, 457], [464, 464], [470, 470], [481, 481], [489, 489], [509, 509], [513, 513]], [[345, 345], [355, 355], [364, 364]], [[236, 238], [487, 488]], [[542, 555], [554, 554], [572, 572], [579, 579], [865, 867]], [[563, 565], [575, 575], [623, 625]], [[554, 555], [579, 580]], [[532, 533], [590, 591]], [[751, 753], [756, 757], [769, 770]], [[760, 762], [768, 768]], [[777, 779], [791, 792], [802, 802], [812, 814], [818, 818]], [[829, 830], [835, 837], [848, 849], [862, 862], [872, 873]], [[202, 202], [865, 868]], [[976, 991], [986, 986]], [[1005, 1008], [1014, 1014], [1028, 1028]], [[996, 1025], [1022, 1022]], [[1036, 1044], [1052, 1052], [1446, 1447], [1454, 1454], [1701, 1702], [1704, 1704]], [[713, 714], [1073, 1074], [1088, 1090], [1156, 1157], [1385, 1386], [1429, 1430]], [[1065, 1069], [1079, 1079], [1153, 1154], [1220, 1223], [1232, 1232], [1280, 1281], [1291, 1291], [1351, 1352]], [[1151, 1151], [1159, 1159]], [[1142, 1145], [1165, 1165], [1178, 1178], [1188, 1188]], [[1203, 1206], [1216, 1216], [1297, 1299], [1308, 1308], [1310, 1310], [1326, 1326], [1329, 1329], [1347, 1348], [1353, 1353], [1363, 1363], [1373, 1373], [1380, 1380], [1426, 1426], [1497, 1498], [1501, 1501], [1513, 1513], [1518, 1518], [1524, 1524], [1564, 1564], [1568, 1568], [1574, 1574], [1586, 1586], [1599, 1599], [1721, 1722], [1726, 1726], [1731, 1732]], [[1227, 1229], [1246, 1246]], [[916, 918], [1250, 1252], [1617, 1619]], [[1212, 1214], [1254, 1254], [1260, 1260], [1264, 1264], [1320, 1322]], [[1267, 1270], [1285, 1285], [1287, 1287]], [[1357, 1366], [1369, 1369]], [[936, 937], [1391, 1392]], [[933, 934], [1394, 1395], [1637, 1638]], [[929, 930], [1404, 1405]], [[1412, 1413], [1418, 1418], [1421, 1421]], [[953, 954], [1437, 1438], [1666, 1667]], [[1049, 1050], [1449, 1452]], [[1463, 1464], [1470, 1470], [1709, 1710]], [[1478, 1482], [1487, 1487], [1492, 1492], [1718, 1719]], [[738, 753], [1527, 1529]], [[925, 926], [1631, 1632], [1634, 1634]], [[1644, 1645], [1647, 1647], [1651, 1651]], [[1481, 1482], [1674, 1675]], [[971, 972], [1681, 1682]], [[1687, 1688], [1699, 1699]], [[1467, 1468], [1714, 1715]], [[1602, 1602], [1731, 1735], [1747, 1747], [1752, 1752]]]"
7,THE DOG AND THE SPARROW,"A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad, my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’ said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed! what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’ ‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’ and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. ‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew. The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.","A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of A shepherd’s dog, but often let A shepherd’s dog suffer the greatest hunger. At last A shepherd’s dog could bear the greatest hunger no longer; so A shepherd’s dog took to A shepherd’s dog's heels, and off A shepherd’s dog ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.

Whilst A shepherd’s dog slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. my, seeing that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which A shepherd’s dog lay, so as to drive over A shepherd’s dog, called out, ‘Stop! stop! a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, or it shall be the worse for a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine.’ But a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, grumbling to a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, ‘my make it the worse for a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, indeed! what can my do?’ cracked a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's whip, and drove a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine over A shepherd’s dog, so that the wheels crushed A shepherd’s dog to death. ‘There,’ cried my, ‘a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine hast killed my's . Now mind what my say. This deed of a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine shall cost a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine all a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine art worth.’ ‘Do my's worst, and welcome,’ said a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, ‘what harm can my do a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine?’ and passed on. But my crept under the tilt of a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, and pecked at the bung of one of two casks of wine till my loosened the bung of one of the casks; and then all the wine ran out, without a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine seeing all the wine. At last a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine looked round, and saw that a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine was dripping, and one of the casks quite empty. ‘What an unlucky wretch a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine am!’ cried a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said my, as my alighted upon the head of one of three horses, and pecked at one of the horses till one of the horses reared up and kicked. When a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine saw this, a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine drew out a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's hatchet and aimed a blow at my, meaning to kill my; but my flew away, and a blow fell upon one of the horses's head with such force, that one of the horses fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine am!’ cried a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said my. And as a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine went on with the other two horses, my again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine saw this, a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine am!’ But my answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at the second horse too. a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine ran up and struck at my again with his hatchet; but away my flew, and his hatchet fell upon the second horse and killed the second horse on the spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine am!’ said a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said my; and perching upon the third horse, my began to peck the third horse too. a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine was mad with fury; and without looking about a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, or caring what a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine was about, struck again at my; but killed the third horse as a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine done the other two horses. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine am!’ cried a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered my as my flew away; ‘now will my plague and punish a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine at a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine own house.’ a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine was forced at last to leave a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine behind a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine to a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's wife, ‘what ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and three horses all three dead.’ ‘Alas! a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine,’ replied his wife, ‘and a wicked bird has come into thy own house, and has brought with a wicked bird all the birds in the world, his wife am sure, and all the birds in the world have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating our corn in the loft up at such a rate!’ Away ran a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up our corn in the loft, with my in the midst of thousands of birds. ‘Unlucky wretch that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine am!’ cried a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine; for a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine saw that our corn in the loft was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said my; ‘a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine cruelty shall cost a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's life yet!’ and away my flew. a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine seeing that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine had thus lost all that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine had, went down into a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's kitchen; and was still not sorry for what a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine had done, but sat a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But my sat on the outside of the window, and cried ‘a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine! thy cruelty shall cost a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's life!’ With that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw his hatchet at my; but his hatchet missed my, and only broke the window. my now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and cried, ‘a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine! it shall cost a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's life!’ Then a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine cleft the window-seat in two: and as my flew from place to place, a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine and his wife were so furious, that the carter and his wife broke all the carter and his wife's furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching my at all. In the end, however, the carter and his wife caught my: and his wife said, ‘Shall his wife kill my at once?’ ‘No,’ cried a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine, ‘kill is letting my off too easily: my shall die a much more cruel death; a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine will eat my.’ But my began to flutter about, and stretch out my's neck and cried, ‘a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine! it shall cost a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's life yet!’ With that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine could wait no longer: so a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine gave his wife his hatchet, and cried, ‘his wife, strike at my and kill my in a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine's hand.’ And his wife struck; but his wife missed his wife's aim, and hit his wife's on the head so that a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine fell down dead, and my flew quietly home to my's nest.","[[[0, 3], [12, 12], [17, 17], [25, 25], [33, 33], [36, 36], [41, 41], [54, 54], [61, 61], [66, 66], [70, 71], [79, 80], [83, 83], [121, 121], [150, 151], [162, 162], [217, 218], [233, 233], [249, 249], [255, 255], [271, 271], [278, 279], [289, 289], [294, 296], [299, 299], [306, 306], [315, 315], [319, 319], [347, 347], [358, 358], [383, 384], [392, 392], [402, 402], [412, 412], [414, 414], [425, 425], [467, 468], [472, 472], [478, 478], [513, 514], [516, 516], [528, 528], [576, 577], [585, 585], [642, 644], [651, 651], [671, 674]], [[19, 21], [28, 28]], [[70, 70], [104, 105], [110, 110], [117, 117], [146, 147], [160, 160], [171, 172], [184, 184], [191, 191], [193, 193], [245, 246], [261, 261], [268, 268], [285, 286], [294, 294], [337, 337], [342, 343], [356, 356], [390, 390], [409, 410], [493, 494], [504, 504], [552, 553], [617, 617], [629, 629], [660, 661], [671, 671], [679, 679], [697, 697], [712, 712], [722, 723], [743, 743], [801, 802], [805, 805], [843, 844], [849, 849], [852, 852], [895, 896], [910, 910], [958, 959], [992, 992], [1000, 1000], [1037, 1038], [1047, 1047], [1077, 1078], [1113, 1114], [1116, 1116], [1123, 1123], [1266, 1267], [1305, 1306], [1321, 1321], [1366, 1367], [1407, 1408], [1413, 1413], [1421, 1422], [1475, 1476], [1516, 1517], [1529, 1529], [1540, 1540], [1556, 1556], [1561, 1561], [1573, 1573], [1577, 1578], [1587, 1587], [1628, 1629], [1632, 1632], [1664, 1665], [1670, 1670]], [[112, 114], [133, 134], [440, 441]], [[129, 129], [138, 138], [431, 431], [445, 446], [461, 461]], [[175, 176], [206, 207]], [[198, 207], [213, 213], [220, 220], [227, 227], [236, 237]], [[273, 274], [282, 283]], [[324, 331], [331, 331], [351, 351]], [[368, 374], [377, 377]], [[399, 400], [405, 405]], [[52, 53], [519, 520]], [[534, 550], [557, 558], [595, 596], [605, 605], [609, 610], [614, 614], [623, 623], [634, 634], [639, 639], [664, 666], [668, 668], [685, 685], [688, 688], [690, 690], [705, 706], [714, 714], [756, 757], [763, 763], [786, 786], [791, 791], [828, 829], [833, 833], [836, 836], [880, 880], [885, 885], [900, 901], [939, 940], [944, 944], [953, 953], [985, 986], [995, 995], [1022, 1022], [1027, 1027], [1054, 1055], [1065, 1065], [1070, 1070], [1082, 1082], [1086, 1086], [1098, 1098], [1103, 1103], [1127, 1127], [1129, 1129], [1134, 1135], [1142, 1142], [1145, 1145], [1162, 1162], [1164, 1164], [1180, 1180], [1190, 1190], [1247, 1248], [1262, 1262], [1278, 1278], [1283, 1284], [1287, 1287], [1309, 1309], [1313, 1313], [1314, 1314], [1324, 1325], [1328, 1328], [1334, 1334], [1340, 1340], [1350, 1350], [1356, 1356], [1379, 1379], [1381, 1381], [1385, 1385], [1386, 1386], [1392, 1392], [1400, 1400], [1438, 1438], [1443, 1443], [1444, 1444], [1449, 1449], [1467, 1467], [1483, 1484], [1486, 1486], [1550, 1550], [1570, 1570], [1593, 1593], [1598, 1598], [1599, 1599], [1606, 1606], [1613, 1613], [1615, 1615], [1634, 1634], [1651, 1652], [1658, 1658]], [[537, 550], [639, 640], [729, 730], [770, 771], [917, 918], [1142, 1143]], [[547, 550], [740, 741]], [[735, 741], [745, 745]], [[749, 751], [759, 759]], [[738, 741], [776, 777]], [[541, 542], [813, 814], [1180, 1181]], [[811, 814], [819, 819], [821, 821], [861, 864], [871, 871]], [[840, 841], [857, 858]], [[726, 730], [914, 918]], [[975, 977], [982, 982], [1008, 1010], [1013, 1013]], [[836, 837], [995, 996], [1004, 1005], [1400, 1401], [1405, 1405], [1411, 1411], [1617, 1618]], [[1043, 1045], [1051, 1051], [1082, 1084]], [[905, 908], [1088, 1090]], [[1164, 1165], [1194, 1194], [1219, 1219], [1486, 1487], [1532, 1533], [1538, 1538], [1615, 1616], [1624, 1624], [1639, 1640], [1644, 1644], [1646, 1646], [1651, 1651]], [[1129, 1131], [1204, 1205]], [[1198, 1200], [1211, 1211]], [[1212, 1217], [1224, 1224]], [[1228, 1232], [1237, 1237], [1262, 1263], [1290, 1291]], [[1253, 1255], [1272, 1272]], [[1309, 1310], [1381, 1382]], [[1429, 1432], [1459, 1462], [1469, 1469]], [[1483, 1487], [1493, 1493], [1496, 1496], [1527, 1527]], [[1539, 1539], [1553, 1553]]]"
8,THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES,"There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been. Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death. A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same manner. Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast asleep.’ Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said he was willing to undertake the task. He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain? And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’ When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully. The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’ Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy. So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses. One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’ On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off. The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the next night. When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However, on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been. As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s heir.","There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. twelve beautiful daughters slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when twelve beautiful daughters went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning twelve beautiful daughters's shoes were found to be quite worn through as if their shoes had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where their shoes had been. Then a king who had twelve beautiful daughters made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that twelve beautiful daughters danced in the night, any person should have the one any person liked best for any person's wife, and should be king after any person's death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death. a king who had twelve beautiful daughters's son soon came. A king’s son was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to one roomtwelve beds. There A king’s son was to sit and watch where twelve beautiful daughters went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without A king’s son's hearing nothing, the door of the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds was left open. But A king’s son soon fell asleep; and when A king’s son awoke in the morning A king’s son found that twelve beautiful daughters had all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing happened the second and third night: so a king who had twelve beautiful daughters ordered a king who had twelve beautiful daughters's head to be cut off. After a king who had twelve beautiful daughters came several others; but several others had all the same luck, and several others lost several others's lives in the same manner. Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, passed through the country where a king who had twelve beautiful daughters reigned: and as an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was travelling through a wood, an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer met an old woman, who asked an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer where an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was going. ‘an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer hardly know where an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer am going, or what an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer had better do,’ said an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer; ‘but an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer think an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer should like very well to find out where it is that twelve beautiful daughters dance, and then in time an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said an old woman, who asked him where he was going, ‘find is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of twelve beautiful daughters will bring to an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer in the evening; and as soon as one of the princesses leaves an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer pretend to be fast asleep.’ Then an old woman, who asked him where he was going gave an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer put a cloak on an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer will become invisible, and an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer will then be able to follow twelve beautiful daughters wherever twelve beautiful daughters go.’ When an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer heard all this good counsel, an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer determined to try an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer's luck: so an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer went to a king who had twelve beautiful daughters, and said an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was willing to undertake the task. an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was as well received as twelve beautiful daughters had been, and a king who had twelve beautiful daughters ordered fine royal robes to be given an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer; and when the evening came an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was led to the outer chamber. Just as an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was going to lie down, the eldest of twelve beautiful daughters brought an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer a cup of wine; but an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer threw a cup of wine away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer laid an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer down on an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer's bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was fast asleep. When twelve beautiful daughters heard began twelve beautiful daughters laughed heartily; and the eldest of the princesses said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer's life in this way!’ Then twelve beautiful daughters rose up and opened twelve beautiful daughters's drawers and boxes, and took out all twelve beautiful daughters's fine clothes, and dressed twelve beautiful daughters at the glass, and skipped about as if twelve beautiful daughters were eager to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘the youngest don’t know how it is, while twelve beautiful daughters are so happy the youngest feel very uneasy; the youngest am sure some mischance will befall us.’ ‘the youngest,’ said the eldest of the princesses, ‘the youngest are always afraid; have the youngest forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain? And as for an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, even if the eldest of the princesses had not given an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer's sleeping draught, an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer would have slept soundly enough.’ When twelve beautiful daughters were all ready, twelve beautiful daughters went and looked at an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer; but an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so twelve beautiful daughters thought twelve beautiful daughters were quite safe; and the eldest of the princesses went up to the eldest of the princesses's own bed and clapped the eldest of the princesses's hands, and her own bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer saw twelve beautiful daughters going down through a trap-door one after another, the eldest of the princesses leading the way; and thinking an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer had no time to lose, an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer jumped up, put on the cloak which an old woman, who asked him where he was going had given an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, and followed twelve beautiful daughters; but in the middle of the stairs an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer trod on the gown of the youngest, and the youngest cried out to the youngest's , ‘All is not right; someone took hold of the gown of the youngest princess.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest of the princesses, ‘the gown of the youngest princess is nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down twelve beautiful daughters went, and at the bottom twelve beautiful daughters found twelve beautiful daughters in a most delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully. an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer wished to take away some token of the place; so an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer broke off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from a little branch. Then the youngest said again, ‘the youngest am sure all is not right--did not you hear a loud noise? a loud noise never happened before.’ But the eldest of the princesses said, ‘It is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our's approach.’ Then our came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering diamonds. And an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest tremble with fear; but the eldest of the princesses still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy. So our went on till our came to a great lake; and at the side of a great lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses, who seemed to be waiting there for twelve beautiful daughters. One of twelve beautiful daughters went into each boat, and an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer stepped into the same boat with the youngest. As our were rowing over a great lake, the prince who was in the same boat with the youngest said, ‘the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier do not know why it is, but though the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier am rowing with all the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier's might our do not get on so fast as usual, and the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier am quite tired: the boat with the youngest princess seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the youngest: ‘the youngest feel it very warm too.’ On the other side of a great lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There our landed, and went into a fine illuminated castle, from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets, and each prince danced with each prince's princess; and an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, danced with twelve beautiful daughters too; and when any of twelve beautiful daughters had a cup of wine set by any of the princesses, any of the princesses drank a cup of wine set by her up, so that when any of the princesses put a cup of wine set by her to any of the princesses's mouth a cup of wine set by her was empty. At this, too, the youngest was terribly frightened, but the eldest of the princesses always silenced the youngest. twelve beautiful daughters danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then all twelve beautiful daughters's shoes were worn out, so that twelve beautiful daughters were obliged to leave off. twelve handsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses rowed twelve beautiful daughters back again over a great lake (but this time an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer placed an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer in the boat with the youngest princess with the youngest); and on the opposite shore twelve beautiful daughters took leave of each other, twelve beautiful daughters promising to come again the next night. When twelve beautiful daughters came to the stairs, an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer ran on before twelve beautiful daughters, and laid an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer down; and as twelve beautiful daughters slowly came up very much tired, twelve beautiful daughters heard an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer snoring in an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer's bed; so twelve beautiful daughters said, ‘Now all is quite safe’; then twelve beautiful daughters undressed twelve beautiful daughters, put away twelve beautiful daughters's fine clothes, pulled off twelve beautiful daughters's shoes, and went to bed. In the morning an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; twelve beautiful daughters danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However, on the third night an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer had been. As soon as the time came when an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was to declare the secret, an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was taken before a king who had twelve beautiful daughters with the three branches and one of the golden cups; and twelve beautiful daughters stood listening behind the door to hear what an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer would say. And when a king who had twelve beautiful daughters asked an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer. ‘Where do a king who had twelve beautiful daughters's dance at night?’ an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And then an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer told a king who had twelve beautiful daughters all that had happened, and showed a king who had twelve beautiful daughters the three branches and the golden cup. Then a king who had twelve beautiful daughters called for twelve beautiful daughters, and asked twelve beautiful daughters whether what an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer said was true: and when twelve beautiful daughters saw that twelve beautiful daughters were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, twelve beautiful daughters confessed it all. And a king who had twelve beautiful daughters asked an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer which of twelve beautiful daughters a king who had twelve beautiful daughters would choose for a king who had twelve beautiful daughters's wife; and an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer answered, ‘a king who had twelve beautiful daughters am not very young, so a king who had twelve beautiful daughters will have the youngest.’--And they were married that very day, and an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer was chosen to be a king who had twelve beautiful daughters heir.","[[[6, 8], [10, 10], [22, 22], [38, 38], [100, 101], [173, 174], [177, 177], [189, 189], [235, 236], [246, 246], [387, 388], [432, 433], [487, 488], [490, 490], [533, 534], [575, 576], [628, 630], [633, 633], [662, 662], [667, 667], [676, 676], [682, 682], [692, 692], [714, 714], [788, 788], [793, 793], [815, 815], [817, 817], [854, 854], [899, 899], [923, 924], [964, 965], [972, 972], [974, 974], [1192, 1193], [1197, 1198], [1362, 1362], [1369, 1370], [1419, 1419], [1432, 1432], [1440, 1440], [1450, 1450], [1478, 1478], [1485, 1486], [1496, 1496], [1507, 1508], [1517, 1519], [1527, 1527], [1536, 1536], [1548, 1548], [1550, 1550], [1554, 1554], [1560, 1560], [1607, 1608], [1613, 1613], [1679, 1681], [1704, 1706], [1759, 1760], [1764, 1764], [1775, 1775], [1778, 1778], [1795, 1795], [1808, 1808]], [[38, 39], [49, 49], [69, 69], [246, 247]], [[2, 8], [74, 75], [147, 149], [217, 219], [264, 265], [267, 267], [275, 275], [323, 324], [514, 515], [539, 540], [1667, 1668], [1696, 1697], [1704, 1704], [1730, 1731], [1739, 1739], [1755, 1756], [1801, 1802], [1809, 1809], [1813, 1813], [1821, 1821], [1828, 1828], [1849, 1851]], [[86, 87], [107, 107], [112, 112], [116, 116], [124, 124]], [[147, 150], [154, 154], [182, 182], [203, 203], [210, 210], [217, 220], [227, 227], [232, 232]], [[17, 18], [170, 179]], [[13, 14], [177, 179]], [[199, 199], [205, 205]], [[166, 179], [210, 211]], [[277, 278], [281, 281], [289, 289], [291, 291]], [[302, 316], [329, 329], [336, 336], [344, 344], [346, 346], [351, 351], [355, 355], [361, 361], [368, 369], [373, 373], [375, 375], [395, 395], [437, 437], [448, 448], [459, 459], [470, 470], [474, 474], [480, 480], [495, 496], [503, 503], [507, 507], [511, 511], [519, 519], [527, 527], [548, 548], [555, 555], [565, 565], [578, 578], [585, 586], [602, 602], [604, 604], [607, 607], [622, 622], [654, 654], [765, 766], [774, 774], [775, 775], [779, 779], [798, 799], [802, 802], [851, 852], [874, 874], [881, 881], [895, 895], [908, 908], [997, 998], [1010, 1010], [1110, 1111], [1205, 1206], [1236, 1237], [1350, 1358], [1460, 1461], [1463, 1463], [1502, 1503], [1512, 1512], [1529, 1529], [1532, 1532], [1571, 1572], [1631, 1632], [1645, 1645], [1656, 1656], [1663, 1663], [1690, 1690], [1699, 1699], [1712, 1712], [1728, 1728], [1748, 1748], [1752, 1752], [1767, 1768], [1804, 1805], [1817, 1817], [1843, 1844]], [[338, 348], [407, 409], [457, 457], [890, 892]], [[381, 381], [412, 412]], [[430, 433], [446, 446]], [[460, 461], [472, 472]], [[579, 582], [588, 589]], [[615, 615], [632, 632]], [[572, 576], [638, 639], [739, 740], [770, 770], [823, 824], [828, 828], [833, 833], [866, 867], [947, 948], [1057, 1058], [1137, 1138], [1413, 1414]], [[700, 701], [705, 705], [718, 718], [723, 723], [734, 735], [743, 743], [749, 749], [914, 916], [919, 919], [923, 923], [936, 936], [1028, 1030], [1035, 1035], [1129, 1131], [1213, 1214], [1232, 1234], [1294, 1295], [1298, 1298], [1405, 1407], [1417, 1417], [1468, 1470], [1831, 1832]], [[828, 830], [837, 838]], [[844, 847], [858, 861]], [[911, 916], [936, 937], [951, 951]], [[1013, 1015], [1024, 1025]], [[1020, 1022], [1047, 1048], [1050, 1050]], [[1065, 1065], [1074, 1074], [1079, 1079], [1155, 1155], [1159, 1159], [1217, 1217], [1258, 1258], [1331, 1332]], [[1162, 1164], [1171, 1172], [1221, 1222], [1311, 1312], [1454, 1455]], [[1175, 1193], [1183, 1183]], [[1209, 1214], [1229, 1237]], [[1224, 1237], [1241, 1241], [1251, 1251], [1256, 1256], [1269, 1269]], [[1229, 1234], [1274, 1275], [1465, 1466]], [[1314, 1328], [1338, 1339]], [[1342, 1343], [1346, 1346]], [[1367, 1370], [1378, 1378], [1380, 1380], [1389, 1389], [1394, 1394]], [[1372, 1378], [1382, 1383], [1391, 1392], [1396, 1396]], [[1179, 1193], [1447, 1448]], [[906, 907], [1499, 1500]], [[1560, 1561], [1613, 1614]], [[1635, 1639], [1674, 1676], [1744, 1752]], [[1670, 1672], [1740, 1742]], [[1670, 1676], [1740, 1752]]]"
9,THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE,"There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish. But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’ said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave. When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage.’ The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:  ‘O man of the sea!   Hearken to me!   My wife Ilsabill   Will have her own will,   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’ Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will? What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at least,’ said his wife. Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said, ‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it very willingly, I know; go along and try!’ The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said:  ‘O man of the sea!   Hearken to me!   My wife Ilsabill   Will have her own will,   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’ ‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man, dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it, before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed. The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’ ‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out:  ‘O man of the sea!   Hearken to me!   My wife Ilsabill   Will have her own will,   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’ ‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king already.’ Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish! I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go at once!’ So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, ‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:  ‘O man of the sea!   Hearken to me!   My wife Ilsabill   Will have her own will,   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’ ‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor already.’ So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’ So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:  ‘O man of the sea!   Hearken to me!   My wife Ilsabill   Will have her own will,   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’ ‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’ Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’ ‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed. ‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’ said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish at once!’ Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea, and cried out, as well as he could:  ‘O man of the sea!   Hearken to me!   My wife Ilsabill   Will have her own will,   And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’ ‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty again.’ And there they live to this very day.","There was once a fisherman who lived with a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside's wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside sat on the shore with a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside's rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside's line, all on a sudden a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside's float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing his float up a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside pulled out a great fish. But a great fish said, ‘Pray let a great fish live! a great fish am not a real fish; a great fish am an enchanted prince: put a great fish in the water again, and let a great fish go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘a great fish need not make so many words about the matter; a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, a great fish, as soon as a great fish please!’ Then a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside put a great fish back into the water, and a great fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind a great fish on the wave. When a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went home to his wifea pigsty, close by the seaside, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside told his wife how a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside had caught a great fish, and how a great fish had told a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside a great fish was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing a great fish speak, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside had let a great fish go again. ‘Did not a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside ask a great fish for anything?’ said his wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here, in a pigsty, close by the seaside; do go back and tell a great fish we want a snug little cottage.’ a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside did not much like the business: however, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went to the seaside; and when a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside came back there the water looked all yellow and green. And a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside stood at the water edge, and said:  ‘O man of the sea!   Hearken to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside! his wife his wife   Will have his wife's own will,   And hath sent a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside to beg a boon of O man of the sea!’ Then a great fish came swimming to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, and said, ‘Well, what is her own will? What does his wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘his wife says that when a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside had caught a great fish, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside ought to have asked a great fish for something before a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside let a great fish go; his wife does not like living any longer in a pigsty, close by the seaside, and wants a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said a great fish; ‘his wife is in a snug little cottage already!’ So a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a snug little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said his wife; ‘is not a snug little cottage much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind a snug little cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘we will try to do so, at least,’ said his wife. Everything went right for a week or two, and then his wife said, ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, there is not near room enough for we in a snug little cottage; a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens and a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits are a great deal too small; his wife should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside again and tell a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside to give we a castle.’ ‘his wife,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside don’t like to go to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside again, for perhaps a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside will be angry; we ought to be easy with a snug little cottage.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said his wife; ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside will do it very willingly, his wife know; go along and try!’ a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went, but a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside's heart was very heavy: and when a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside came to the sea, the sea looked blue and gloomy, though the sea was very calm; and a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went close to the edge of the waves, and said:  ‘O man of the seathe sea!   Hearken to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside! his wife his wife   Will have his wife's own will,   And hath sent a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside to beg a boon of O man of the sea!’ ‘Well, what does his wife want now?’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. ‘Ah!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, dolefully, ‘his wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside; ‘his wife is standing at the gate of a stone castle already.’ So away went a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, and found his wife standing before the gate of it. ‘See,’ said his wife, ‘is not a stone castle grand?’ With that we went into a stone castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind a stone castle was a garden, and around a garden was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘now we will live cheerful and happy in a stone castle for the rest of we's lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said his wife; ‘but let we sleep upon a stone castle, before we make up we's minds to live.’ So we went to bed. The next morning when his wife awoke it was broad daylight, and his wife jogged a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside with his wife's elbow, and said, ‘Get up, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, and bestir a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘his wife, wife,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘why should we wish to be the king? a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside will not be king.’ ‘Then his wife will,’ said his wife. ‘But, his wife,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘how can his wife be king--a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside cannot make his wife a king?’ ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside,’ said his wife, ‘say no more about it, but go and try! his wife will be king.’ So a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside cried out:  ‘O man of the seathe sea!   Hearken to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside! his wife his wife   Will have his wife's own will,   And hath sent a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside to beg a boon of O man of the sea!’ ‘Well, what would his wife have now?’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. ‘Alas!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘his wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside; ‘his wife is king already.’ Then a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went home; and as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside came close to the palace a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went in a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon his wife's head; and on each side of his wife stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, his wife,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘are his wife king?’ ‘Yes,’ said his wife, ‘his wife am king.’ And when a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside had looked at his wife for a long time, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside said, ‘Ah, his wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live.’ ‘his wife don’t know how that may be,’ said his wife; ‘never is a long time. his wife am king, it is true; but his wife begin to be tired of king, and his wife think his wife should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, his wife! why should his wife wish to be emperor?’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside,’ said his wife, ‘go to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside! his wife say his wife will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, his wife!’ replied a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside cannot make an emperor, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside am sure, and a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside should not like to ask a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside for such a thing.’ ‘his wife am king,’ said his wife, ‘and a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside are his wife's slave; so go at once!’ So a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside was forced to go; and a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside muttered as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went along, ‘This will come to no good, This is too much to ask; a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside soon came to the seaside; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled the waves about, but a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went as near as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside could to the water's brink, and said:  ‘O man of the seathe sea!   Hearken to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside! his wife his wife   Will have his wife's own will,   And hath sent a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside to beg a boon of O man of the sea!’ ‘What would his wife have now?’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. ‘Ah!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘his wife wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside; ‘his wife is emperor already.’ So a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went home again; and as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside came near a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside saw his wife sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on his wife's head full two yards high; and on each side of his wife stood his wife's guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than his wife's finger. And before his wife's stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went up to his wife and said, ‘his wife, are his wife emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said his wife, ‘his wife am emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside gazed upon his wife, ‘what a fine thing it is to be emperor!’ ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside,’ said his wife, ‘why should we stop at being emperor? his wife will be pope next.’ ‘his wife, his wife!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘how can his wife be pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside,’ said his wife, ‘his wife will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside cannot make his wife pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said his wife; ‘if a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside can make an emperor, a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside can make a pope: go and try a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside.’ So a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went. But when a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside was dreadfully frightened, and a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside trembled so that a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside's knees knocked together: but still a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went down near to the shore, and said:  ‘O man of the seathe sea!   Hearken to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside! his wife his wife   Will have his wife's own will,   And hath sent a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside to beg a boon of O man of the sea!’ ‘What does his wife want now?’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. ‘Ah!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘his wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside; ‘his wife is pope already.’ Then a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went home, and found his wife sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold. And his wife had three great crowns on his wife's head, and around his wife stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side of his wife were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. ‘his wife,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside looked at all this greatness, ‘are his wife pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said his wife, ‘his wife am pope.’ ‘Well, his wife,’ replied a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now his wife must be easy, for his wife can be nothing greater.’ ‘his wife will think about that,’ said his wife. Then we went to bed: but his wife could not sleep all night for thinking what his wife should be next. At last, as his wife was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought his wife, as his wife woke up and looked at the sun through the window, ‘after all his wife cannot prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought his wife was very angry, and wakened his wife's , and said, ‘a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, go to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside and tell a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside his wife must be lord of the sun and moon.’ a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside was half asleep, but the thought frightened a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside so much that a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside started and fell out of bed. ‘Alas, his wife!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘cannot his wife be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’ said his wife, ‘his wife am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without his wife's leave. Go to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside at once!’ Then a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside went shivering with fear; and as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon her head. And a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside crept towards the sea, and cried out, as well as a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside could:  ‘O man of the seathe sea!   Hearken to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside! his wife his wife   Will have his wife's own will,   And hath sent a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside to beg a boon of O man of the sea!’ ‘What does his wife want now?’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. ‘Ah!’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘his wife wants to be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside, ‘to a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside's pigsty again.’ And there we live to this very day.","[[[3, 17], [8, 8], [19, 20], [37, 37], [43, 43], [53, 53], [60, 60], [75, 75], [126,

10,THE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR,"Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’ said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’ The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come. When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle. Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried: ‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the night.","Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that the bear said: ‘the wolf, what bird is a bird that sings so well?’ ‘a bird is the King of birds,’ said the wolf, ‘before whom the bear and the wolf must bow down.’ In reality a bird was the willow-wren. ‘IF is’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘the bear should very much like to see the King of birds's royal palace; come, take the bear thither.’ ‘take is not done quite as the bear seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘the bear must wait until the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in the Queen's beak, and the King of birds came too, and they began to feed they's young ones. the bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held the bear back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, the bear must wait until they have gone away again.’ So the bear and the wolf took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. the bear, however, could not rest until the bear had seen his royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to his royal palace again. they had just flown out, so the bear peeped in and saw their young ones lying there. ‘Is that his royal palace?’ cried the bear; ‘his royal palace is a wretched palace, and their young ones are not the King of birds's children, their young ones are disreputable children!’ When their young ones heard that, their young ones were frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that their young ones are not! their young ones's are honest people! the bear, the bear will have to pay for are!’ the bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into the bear and the wolf's holes. their young ones, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their young ones's again brought food their young ones said: ‘their young ones will not so much as touch one fly’s leg, no, not if their young ones were dying of hunger, until they have settled whether their young ones are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted their young ones!’ Then the King of birds said: ‘Be easy, the bear shall be punished,’ and the King of birds at once flew with the Queen to the bear cave, and called in: ‘the bear, why have the bear insulted the King of birds's children? the bear shall suffer for insulted--we will punish the bear by a bloody war.’ Thus war was announced to the bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in war, all four-footed animals.

And now at last their young ones were satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the night.","[[[5, 6], [17, 18], [26, 26], [84, 85], [88, 88], [102, 102], [113, 113], [124, 124], [162, 163], [176, 176], [188, 188], [219, 220], [228, 228], [258, 258], [280, 281], [333, 333], [335, 335], [344, 345], [420, 421], [441, 441], [456, 458], [466, 467], [471, 471], [476, 476], [485, 485], [497, 498], [632, 633], [636, 636], [641, 641], [1023, 1024], [1057, 1059], [1065, 1065], [1067, 1067], [1088, 1088], [1096, 1097]], [[8, 9], [30, 31], [53, 54], [120, 121], [173, 174], [347, 348]], [[20, 21], [36, 36], [44, 44], [67, 68]], [[5, 9], [59, 59], [204, 204], [344, 348], [358, 358]], [[45, 45], [77, 77]], [[46, 49], [95, 95], [147, 149], [294, 295], [432, 434], [448, 448], [473, 473]], [[101, 101], [107, 107]], [[128, 129], [136, 137], [143, 143], [453, 454]], [[154, 154], [158, 158], [192, 196], [248, 251], [327, 328], [377, 378], [409, 409], [977, 980], [984, 984], [1003, 1003]], [[95, 97], [231, 233], [245, 245], [274, 276], [284, 284]], [[158, 160], [263, 267], [291, 291], [298, 298], [305, 307], [311, 311], [323, 323], [327, 327], [361, 365], [377, 377], [382, 382], [386, 386], [402, 402], [413, 413], [428, 428], [1011, 1013], [1017, 1017], [1038, 1038], [1044, 1044], [1114, 1116]], [[329, 329], [341, 341]], [[472, 472], [480, 480]], [[493, 493], [512, 512], [569, 570]], [[501, 505], [514, 528], [788, 793], [947, 948], [952, 952]], [[70, 73], [531, 534], [574, 577], [772, 775], [806, 809], [811, 811], [848, 851]], [[594, 601], [615, 615], [750, 751], [756, 756]], [[638, 639], [646, 646], [648, 648], [657, 657], [671, 672], [690, 691], [695, 695], [714, 714], [716, 716], [734, 734], [862, 864], [875, 876], [882, 882], [886, 886], [895, 895], [902, 902], [914, 914], [929, 929], [940, 940], [943, 943]], [[608, 609], [663, 663], [728, 728], [745, 745]], [[697, 711], [716, 717], [736, 736], [862, 865], [902, 903], [919, 919], [940, 941]], [[526, 527], [802, 803]], [[839, 840], [841, 841]], [[854, 855], [871, 871]], [[888, 889], [897, 897]], [[963, 963], [965, 965]], [[782, 783], [973, 974], [1006, 1007]], [[473, 474], [984, 985], [990, 990], [998, 998], [1075, 1076], [1080, 1080], [1107, 1107]], [[211, 212], [1028, 1029], [1072, 1073]], [[965, 966], [1057, 1060]], [[1051, 1054], [1075, 1075]]]"
11,THE FROG-PRINCE,"One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.’ Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, ‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’ The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could. The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word. The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,   Open the door to thy true love here!   And mind the words that thou and I said   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’ Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her, asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.’ While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,   Open the door to thy true love here!   And mind the words that thou and I said   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’ Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess, ‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. ‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.’ But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:  ‘Open the door, my princess dear,   Open the door to thy true love here!   And mind the words that thou and I said   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’ And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed. He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.’ The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst. They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.","One fine evening a young princess put on a young princess's bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by a young princess in a wood; and when a young princess came to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of a wood, a young princess sat a young princess down to rest a while. Now a young princess had a golden ball in a young princess's hand, which was a young princess's favourite plaything; and a young princess was always tossing a golden ball up into the air, and catching a golden ball again as a golden ball fell. After a time a young princess threw a golden ball up so high that a young princess missed catching a golden ball as a golden ball fell; and a golden ball bounded away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last a golden ball fell down into a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it. a young princess looked into a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it after a golden ball, but a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it was very deep, so deep that a young princess could not see the bottom of a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it. Then a young princess began to bewail a young princess's loss, and said, ‘Alas! if a young princess could only get a golden ball again, a young princess would give all a young princess's fine clothes and jewels, and everything that a young princess have in the world.’ Whilst a young princess was speaking, a frog put a frog's head out of the water, and said, ‘a young princess, why do a young princess weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said a young princess, ‘what can a frog do for a young princess, a frog? a golden ball has fallen into a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it.’ a frog said, ‘a frog want not a young princess's pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if a young princess will love a frog, and let a frog live with a young princess and eat from off a young princess's golden plate, and sleep upon a young princess's bed, a frog will bring a young princess a golden ball again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought a young princess, ‘a frog is talking! a frog can never even get out of a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it to visit a young princess, though a frog may be able to get a golden ball for a young princess, and therefore a young princess will tell a frog a frog shall have what a frog asks.’ So a young princess said to a frog, ‘Well, if a frog will bring a young princess a golden ball, a young princess will do all a frog ask.’ Then a frog put its head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while a frog came up again, with a golden ball in a frog's mouth, and threw a golden ball on the edge of a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it. As soon as a young princess saw a golden ball, a young princess ran to pick a golden ball up; and a young princess was so overjoyed to have a golden ball in her hand again, that a young princess never thought of a frog, but ran home with a golden ball as fast as a young princess could. a frog called after a young princess, ‘Stay, a young princess, and take a young princess with a frog as a frog said,’ But a young princess did not stop to hear a word. The next day, just as a young princess had sat down to dinner, a young princess heard a strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:  ‘Open the door, a frog's ,   Open the door to a young princess's true love here!   And mind the words that thou and I said   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’ Then a young princess ran to the door and opened the door, and there a young princess saw a frog. At this sight a young princess was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as a young princess could came back to a young princess's seat. a frog, seeing that something had frightened a young princess, asked a young princess what was the matter. ‘There is a frog,’ said a young princess, ‘at the door, that lifted a young princess's ball for a young princess out of a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it this morning: a young princess told a frog that a frog should live with a young princess here, thinking that a frog could never get out of a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it; but there a frog is at the door, and a frog wants to come in.’ While a young princess was speaking a frog knocked again at the door, and said:  ‘Open the door, a frog's ,   Open the door to thy true love here!   And mind the words that thou and I said   By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shadethou and I I the fountain coolthe greenwood shade.’ Then a frog said to a young princess, ‘As a young princess have given a young princess's word a young princess must keep your word; so go and let a frog in.’ a young princess did so, and a frog hopped into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the bottom of the room to the top, till a frog came up close to the table where a young princess sat. ‘Pray lift a frog upon chair,’ said a frog to a young princess, ‘and let a frog sit next to a young princess.’ As soon as a young princess had done lift, a frog said, ‘Put a young princess's plate nearer to a frog, that a frog may eat out of your plate.’ Put a young princess did, and when a frog had eaten as much as a frog could, a frog said, ‘Now a frog am tired; carry a frog upstairs, and put a frog into a young princess's bed.’ And a young princess, though very unwilling, took a frog up in a young princess's hand, and put a frog upon the pillow of a young princess's own bed, where a frog slept all night long. As soon as it was light a frog jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. ‘Now, then,’ thought a young princess, ‘at last a frog is gone, and a young princess shall be troubled with a frog no more.’ But a young princess was mistaken; for when night came again a young princess heard the same tapping at the door; and a frog came once more, and said:  ‘Open the door, a frog's ,   Open the door to thy true love here!

And the third night a frog did the same. But when a young princess awoke on the following morning a young princess was astonished to see, instead of a frog, a handsome prince, gazing on a young princess with the most beautiful eyes a young princess had ever seen, and standing at the head of a young princess's bed. He told a young princess that He had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed He into a frog; and that He had been fated so to abide till some princess should take He out of a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, and let He eat from some princess's plate, and sleep upon some princess's bed for three nights. ‘a young princess,’ said He, ‘have broken a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog's cruel charm, and now He have nothing to wish for but that a young princess should go with He into He's father’s kingdom, where He will marry a young princess, and love a young princess as long as a young princess live.’ a young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind a gay coach rode He's servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of He during He's enchantment so long and so bitterly, that his's heart had well-nigh burst. They then took leave of a frog, and got into a gay coacheight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness, and They set out, full of joy and merriment, for He's kingdom, which They reached safely; and there They lived happily a great many years.","[[[3, 5], [8, 8], [21, 21], [28, 28], [45, 45], [47, 47], [55, 55], [61, 61], [66, 66], [71, 71], [92, 92], [99, 99], [130, 131], [137, 137], [149, 149], [159, 159], [163, 163], [173, 173], [177, 177], [181, 181], [185, 185], [194, 194], [202, 202], [220, 220], [224, 224], [235, 235], [243, 243], [249, 249], [267, 267], [279, 279], [289, 289], [294, 294], [301, 301], [307, 307], [308, 308], [319, 320], [340, 340], [349, 349], [352, 352], [356, 356], [369, 369], [382, 382], [383, 383], [386, 386], [439, 441], [443, 443], [446, 446], [454, 454], [462, 462], [467, 467], [482, 482], [489, 489], [494, 494], [498, 498], [507, 507], [522, 523], [530, 530], [581, 583], [590, 590], [618, 619], [630, 630], [636, 636], [644, 644], [656, 656], [661, 661], [667, 667], [675, 675], [678, 678], [693, 693], [702, 702], [705, 705], [713, 713], [721, 721], [752, 752], [772, 774], [781, 781], [813, 815], [819, 819], [822, 822], [824, 824], [837, 837], [881, 882], [896, 897], [906, 906], [912, 912], [923, 923], [939, 939], [970, 970], [975, 976], [986, 986], [996, 996], [1034, 1035], [1045, 1045], [1056, 1056], [1065, 1065], [1090, 1092], [1099, 1099], [1128, 1129], [1141, 1141], [1162, 1163], [1169, 1169], [1186, 1186], [1192, 1192], [1203, 1203], [1208, 1208], [1265, 1265], [1289, 1289], [1304, 1304], [1308, 1308], [1312, 1312], [1316, 1318]], [[23, 24], [43, 43]], [[57, 59], [75, 75], [83, 83], [86, 86], [94, 94], [102, 102], [104, 104], [108, 109], [123, 123], [137, 138], [177, 178], [249, 251], [308, 309], [349, 350], [383, 384], [420, 421], [428, 428], [443, 444], [450, 450], [460, 460], [478, 478]], [[31, 43], [127, 128], [134, 135], [141, 141], [156, 156], [255, 256], [336, 337], [433, 434], [708, 709], [732, 733], [1244, 1245]], [[206, 207], [209, 209], [240, 240], [245, 247], [259, 260], [264, 264], [282, 282], [286, 286], [304, 304], [323, 325], [329, 329], [343, 343], [359, 359], [360, 360], [364, 364], [372, 373], [379, 379], [390, 390], [395, 396], [398, 398], [414, 414], [423, 423], [471, 472], [485, 486], [500, 500], [502, 502], [581, 581], [632, 639], [664, 668], [687, 689], [715, 715], [717, 717], [726, 726], [737, 737], [744, 744], [755, 756], [772, 772], [809, 810], [833, 833], [842, 843], [873, 873], [888, 888], [894, 894], [902, 902], [917, 918], [927, 927], [930, 930], [944, 944], [950, 950], [953, 953], [958, 958], [963, 963], [968, 968], [983, 983], [991, 991], [1001, 1001], [1013, 1013], [1040, 1040], [1050, 1050], [1075, 1076], [1090, 1090], [1112, 1112], [1133, 1134], [1155, 1155], [1177, 1178], [1407, 1408]], [[209, 210], [398, 399]], [[213, 214], [406, 407]], [[61, 62], [462, 463]], [[563, 564], [578, 579], [587, 588], [622, 623], [626, 626], [651, 652], [697, 698], [740, 741], [760, 761], [769, 770], [778, 779], [1071, 1072], [1087, 1088], [1096, 1097], [1131, 1132]], [[590, 593], [781, 784], [1099, 1101], [1099, 1102]], [[598, 614], [789, 805], [1107, 1123]], [[601, 603], [792, 794], [1110, 1112]], [[603, 603], [794, 794]], [[607, 609], [798, 800], [1116, 1117], [1116, 1118]], [[612, 614], [803, 805], [1121, 1123]], [[822, 823], [827, 827]], [[846, 847], [866, 867]], [[887, 887], [915, 915]], [[923, 924], [935, 935]], [[922, 922], [938, 938]], [[1206, 1206], [1210, 1210], [1222, 1222], [1229, 1229], [1241, 1241], [1249, 1249], [1269, 1270], [1281, 1281], [1293, 1293], [1295, 1295], [1301, 1301], [1367, 1369], [1381, 1383], [1385, 1385], [1431, 1433]], [[1237, 1238], [1252, 1252], [1258, 1258]], [[1215, 1225], [1275, 1275]], [[1341, 1343], [1364, 1365], [1413, 1417]], [[1381, 1381], [1394, 1394]], [[1348, 1360], [1416, 1417]], [[1402, 1402], [1420, 1420], [1437, 1437], [1443, 1443]]]"
12,CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. ‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home. ‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’ Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’ ‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!’ The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off! Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep. From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.","A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to a mouse about the great love and friendship A certain cat felt for a mouse, that at length a mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. ‘But they must make a provision for winter, or else they shall suffer from hunger,’ said A certain cat; ‘and a mouse, a mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or a mouse will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put a pot of fat.

A certain cat am again asked to be godmother, and, as a little son has a white ring round a little son's neck, A certain cat cannot refuse.’ a mouse consented, but A certain cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,’ said A certain cat, and was quite satisfied with A certain cat's day’s work. When A certain cat went home a mouse inquired: ‘And what was a little son christened?’ ‘Half-done,’ answered A certain cat. ‘Half-done! What are A certain cat saying? a mouse never heard the name in a mouse's life, a mouse’ll wager anything the name is not in the calendar!’ A certain cat's mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good things go in threes,’ said A certain cat, ‘A certain cat am asked to stand godmother again. a little son is quite black, only a little son has white paws, but with has, a little son has not a single white hair on a little son's whole body; this only happens once every few years, a mouse will let A certain cat go, won’t a mouse?’ ‘Top-off! Half-done!’ answered a mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make a mouse very thoughtful.’ ‘a mouse sit at home,’ said A certain cat, ‘in a mouse's dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because a mouse do not go out in the daytime.’ During A certain cat's absence a mouse cleaned the house, and put the house in order, but A certain cat entirely emptied a pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some peace,’ said A certain cat to A certain cat, and well filled and fat A certain cat did not return home till night. a mouse at once asked what name had been given to a little son. ‘It will not please a mouse more than the others,’ said A certain cat. ‘a little son is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried a mouse ‘All-gone is the most suspicious name of all! a mouse have never seen All-gone in print. All-gone; what can All-gone mean?’ and A certain cat shook A certain cat's head, curled A certain cat up, and lay down to sleep. From this time forth no one invited A certain cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, a mouse thought of they's provision, and said: ‘Come, A certain cat, they will go to they's pot of fat which they have stored up for they--they shall enjoy our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves.’ ‘Yes,’ answered A certain cat, ‘a mouse will enjoy our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves as much as a mouse would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of a mouse out of the window.’ they set out on they's way, but when they arrived, a pot of fat certainly was still in a pot of fat's place, but a pot of fat was empty. ‘Alas!’ said a mouse, ‘now a mouse see what has happened, now it comes to light! A certain cat are a true friend! A certain cat have devoured all when A certain cat were standing A certain cat. First top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will a mouse hold a mouse's tongue,’ cried A certain cat, ‘one word more, and A certain cat will eat a mouse too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on a mouse's lips; scarcely had a mouse spoken ‘All-gone’ before A certain cat sprang on a mouse, seized a mouse, and swallowed a mouse down. Verily, that is the way of the world.","[[[8, 9], [17, 17], [27, 27], [32, 33], [69, 69], [71, 72], [80, 80], [201, 202], [209, 209], [212, 213], [261, 261], [267, 267], [277, 278], [298, 298], [300, 300], [310, 310], [424, 425], [476, 477], [521, 521], [542, 543], [546, 546], [591, 593], [647, 648], [680, 680], [686, 686], [689, 689], [772, 772], [780, 780], [794, 795], [806, 806], [812, 812], [824, 824], [843, 843], [858, 859], [911, 912], [931, 931], [958, 959], [970, 970], [1034, 1035], [1080, 1080], [1087, 1087], [1095, 1095], [1135, 1136], [1140, 1140], [1181, 1181], [1183, 1183], [1200, 1200], [1212, 1215], [1220, 1220], [1228, 1228], [1231, 1231], [1235, 1235]], [[0, 2], [24, 24], [64, 65], [122, 123], [127, 127], [189, 190], [205, 205], [215, 215], [229, 229], [242, 242], [255, 255], [288, 288], [321, 322], [336, 336], [366, 366], [385, 385], [392, 392], [395, 395], [410, 410], [418, 418], [430, 430], [446, 447], [465, 466], [495, 495], [507, 508], [529, 530], [539, 539], [549, 549], [564, 564], [585, 585], [597, 598], [631, 631], [638, 638], [644, 644], [667, 668], [677, 677], [701, 703], [724, 724], [727, 727], [775, 775], [819, 820], [854, 856], [871, 873], [894, 894], [896, 896], [903, 903], [939, 940], [989, 989], [991, 991], [995, 995], [1011, 1012], [1047, 1047], [1076, 1077], [1152, 1152], [1158, 1158], [1163, 1163], [1166, 1166], [1188, 1189], [1197, 1197], [1224, 1225]], [[36, 36], [46, 46], [56, 56], [106, 106], [153, 153], [166, 166], [1038, 1038], [1049, 1049], [1053, 1053], [1058, 1058], [1063, 1063], [1065, 1065], [1102, 1102], [1106, 1106], [1111, 1111]], [[98, 101], [113, 113], [132, 132], [156, 156], [164, 164], [172, 172], [176, 177], [196, 196], [345, 348], [354, 354], [361, 362], [398, 401], [876, 879], [1114, 1117], [1122, 1122], [1126, 1126]], [[219, 221], [234, 234], [246, 246], [455, 456], [575, 576], [582, 582], [655, 656], [735, 736], [742, 742], [752, 752], [760, 760], [922, 924], [943, 943]], [[140, 141], [340, 341], [605, 606]], [[480, 480], [490, 490], [511, 511]], [[264, 265], [557, 558], [861, 862], [866, 866]], [[683, 684], [693, 693]], [[743, 743], [749, 750]], [[798, 798], [804, 804]], [[952, 954], [961, 961], [974, 974], [984, 984]], [[1053, 1063], [1068, 1068], [1083, 1083]], [[1204, 1208], [1222, 1222]]]"
13,THE GOOSE-GIRL,"The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada, and could speak. When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom’s kingdom. One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’ And the lock answered her, and said:  ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’ But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again. Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’ Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said, ‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:  ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’ And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid’s shabby ones. At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well. Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court below. Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was Curdken. But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate. Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate, she said sorrowfully:  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’ and the head answered:  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!   Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’ Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks out, but she cried:  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!   Let Curdken’s hat go!   Blow, breezes, blow!   Let him after it go!   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,   Away be it whirl’d   Till the silvery locks   Are all comb’d and curl’d! Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards. The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’ and the head answered:  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!   Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’ Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!   Let Curdken’s hat go!   Blow, breezes, blow!   Let him after it go!   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,   Away be it whirl’d   Till the silvery locks   Are all comb’d and curl’d! Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way, over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they watched the geese till it grew dark. In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:  ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’ and the head answers:  ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!   Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’ And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say:  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!   Let Curdken’s hat go!   Blow, breezes, blow!   Let him after it go!   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,   Away be it whirl’d   Till the silvery locks   Are all comb’d and curl’d! And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’ But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on. When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.","The king of a great land died, and left The king of a great land's queen to take care of their only child. their only child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and his queen loved their only child dearly, and was very kind to their only child. And there was a good fairy too, who was fond of their only child, and helped his queen to watch over their only child. When their only child grew up, their only child was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for their only child to be married, their only child got ready to set off on their only child's journey to a prince who lived a great way off's country. Then his queenhis queen, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride. And his queen gave their only child a waiting-maid to ride with their only child, and give their only child into a prince who lived a great way off's hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now their only child horse was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her's gift, and the princess’s horse was called Falada, and could speak. When the time came for them to set out, a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her went into a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her's bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her's hair, and gave a lock of her hair to their only child, and said, ‘Take care of a lock of her hair, their only child; for a lock of her hair is a charm that may be of use to their only child on the road.’ Then they all took a sorrowful leave of their only child; and their only child put a lock of her hair into their only child's bosom, got upon the princess’s horse, and set off on their only child's journey to his country. One day, as they were riding along by a brook, their only child began to feel very thirsty: and their only child said to a waiting-maid to ride with her, ‘Pray get down, and fetch their only child some water in their only child's golden cup out of a brook, for their only child want to drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said a waiting-maid to ride with her, ‘if their only child are thirsty, get off their only child, and stoop down by the water and drink; a waiting-maid to ride with her shall not be their only child's waiting-maid any longer.’ Then their only child was so thirsty that their only child got down, and knelt over a brook, and drank; for their only child was frightened, and dared not bring out my golden cup; and their only child wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of their only child?’ And the lock answered their only child, and said:  ‘Alas! alas! if his queen knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would his queen rue it.’ But their only child was very gentle and meek, so their only child said nothing to a waiting-maid to ride with her's ill behaviour, but got upon the princess’s horse again. Then they rode farther on the journey, till the day grew so warm, and the sun so scorching, that their only child began to feel very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to a river, their only child forgot a waiting-maid to ride with her's rude speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch their only child some water to drink in my golden cup.’ But a waiting-maid to ride with her answered their only child, and even spoke more haughtily than before: ‘Drink if their only child will, but a waiting-maid to ride with her shall not be their only child's waiting-maid.’ Then their only child was so thirsty that their only child got off the princess’s horse, and lay down, and held their only child's head over the running stream, and cried and said, ‘What will become of their only child?’ And a lock of her hair answered their only child again:  ‘Alas! alas! if his queen knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would his queen rue it.’ And as their only child leaned down to drink, a lock of her hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now their only child was so frightened that their only child did not see a lock of her hair; but a waiting-maid to ride with her saw a lock of her hair, and was very glad, for a waiting-maid to ride with her knew the charm; and a waiting-maid to ride with her saw that their only child would be in a waiting-maid to ride with her's power, now that their only child had lost a lock of her hair. So when their only child had done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, a waiting-maid to ride with her said, ‘a waiting-maid to ride with her shall ride upon Falada, and their only child may have a waiting-maid to ride with her's instead’; so their only child was forced to give up the princess’s horse, and soon afterwards to take off their only child's royal clothes and put on a waiting-maid to ride with her's shabby ones. At last, as they drew near the end of the journey, this treacherous servant threatened to kill this treacherous servant's if their only child ever told anyone what had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it all well. Then a waiting-maid to ride with her got upon Falada, and their only child rode upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court. There was great joy at they's coming, and the prince flew to meet they, and lifted a waiting-maid to ride with her from a waiting-maid to ride with her's , thinking a waiting-maid to ride with her was the one who was to be the prince's wife; and a waiting-maid to ride with her was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but their only child was told to stay in the court below. Now the prince happened just then to have nothing else to do; so the prince amused the prince by sitting at the prince's kitchen window, looking at what was going on; and the prince saw their only child in the courtyard. As their only child looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, the prince went up into the royal chamber to ask their only child who it was their only child had brought with their only child, that was thus left standing in the court below. ‘his queen brought their only child with his queen for the sake of their only child's company on the road,’ said his queen; ‘pray give their only child some work to do, that their only child may not be idle.’ the prince could not for some time think of any work for their only child to do; but at last the prince said, ‘the prince have a lad who takes care of the prince's geese; their only child may go and help a lad who takes care of my geese.’ Now the name of a lad who takes care of my geesemy geese, was Curdken. But their only child said to the prince, ‘the prince, pray do their only child one piece of kindness.’ ‘That the prince will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of his queen's slaughterers to cut off the head of the princess’s horse, for the princess’s horse was very unruly, and plagued their only child sadly on the road’; but the truth was, their only child was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all Falada had done to their only child. their only child carried their only child's point, and Falada was killed; but when their only child heard of killed, their only child wept, and begged one of your slaughterers to nail up the head of the horse I rode upon against a large dark gate of the city, through which their only child had to pass every morning and evening, that there their only child might still see Falada sometimes. Then one of your slaughterers said one of your slaughterers would do as their only child wished; and cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, and nailed the head of the horse I rode upon up under a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening. Early the next morning, as their only child and a lad who takes care of my geese went out through a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, their only child said sorrowfully:  ‘Falada, Falada, there Falada hangest!’ and the head of the horse I rode upon answered:  ‘Bride, bride, there Bride, bride gangest!   Alas! alas! if his queen knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would his queen rue it.’ Then she and Curdken went out of the city, and drove my geese on. And when their only child came to the meadow, their only child sat down upon a bank there, and let down their only child's waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when a lad who takes care of my geese saw her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver glitter in the sun, a lad who takes care of my geese ran up, and would have pulled some of her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver out, but their only child cried:  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!   Let a lad who takes care of my geese hat go!   Blow, breezes, blow!   Let a lad who takes care of my geese after Curdken’s hat go!   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,   Away be Curdken’s hat whirl’d   Till her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver   Are all comb’d and curl’d! Then there came a wind, so strong that a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat blew off Curdken’s hat; and away Curdken’s hat flew over the hills: and a lad who takes care of my geese was forced to turn and run after Curdken’s hat; till, by the time a lad who takes care of my geese came back, their only child had done combing and curling her hair, and had put her hair up again safe. Then a lad who takes care of my geese was very angry and sulky, and would not speak to their only child at all; but she and Curdken watched my geese until it grew dark in the evening, and then drove my geese homewards. The next morning, as she and Curdken were going through the dark gate, their only child looked up at Falada's head, and cried:  ‘Falada, Falada, there Falada hangest!’ and Falada’s head answered:  ‘Bride, bride, there their only child gangest!   Alas! alas! if his queen knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would his queen rue it.’ Then their only child drove on my geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began to comb out her hair as before; and a lad who takes care of my geese ran up to their only child, and wanted to take hold of her hair; but their only child cried out quickly:  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!   Let Curdken’s hat go!   Blow, breezes, blow!   Let a lad who takes care of my geese after Curdken’s hat go!   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,   Away be Curdken’s hat whirl’d   Till her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver   Are all comb’d and curl’d! Then the wind came and blew away Curdken’s hat; and off Curdken’s hat flew a great way, over the hills and far away, so that a lad who takes care of my geese had to run after Curdken’s hat; and when a lad who takes care of my geese came back their only child had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So she and Curdken watched my geese till it grew dark. In the evening, after she and Curdken came home, a lad who takes care of my geese went to the prince, and said, ‘a lad who takes care of my geese cannot have their only child to help a lad who takes care of my geese to keep my geese any longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the prince. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, their only child does nothing but tease a lad who takes care of my geese all day long.’ Then the prince made a lad who takes care of my geese tell the prince what had happened. And a lad who takes care of my geese said, ‘When she and Curdken go in the morning through a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening with she and Curdken's flock of geese, their only child cries and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:  ‘Falada, Falada, there Falada hangest!’ and the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall answers:  ‘Bride, bride, there their only child gangest!   Alas! alas! if his queen knew it,   Sadly, sadly, would his queen rue it.’ And a lad who takes care of my geese went on telling the prince what had happened upon the meadow where my geese fed; how Curdken’s hat was blown away; and how a lad who takes care of my geese was forced to run after Curdken’s hat, and to leave our flock of geese to our flock of geese. But the prince told a lad who takes care of my geese to go out again the next day: and when morning came, a lad who takes care of my geese placed a lad who takes care of my geese behind a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, and heard how their only child spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then a lad who takes care of my geese went into the field, and hid a lad who takes care of my geese in a bush by the meadow's side; and a lad who takes care of my geese soon saw with a lad who takes care of my geese's own eyes how she and Curdken drove our flock of geese; and how, after a little time, their only child let down their only child's hair that glittered in the sun. And then a lad who takes care of my geese heard their only child say:  ‘Blow, breezes, blow!   Let Curdken’s hat go!   Blow, breezes, blow!   Let a lad who takes care of my geese after Curdken’s hat go!   O’er hills, dales, and rocks,   Away be it whirl’d   Till the silvery locks   Are all comb’d and curl’d! And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away went a lad who takes care of my geese after Curdken’s hat, while their only child went on combing and curling her hair. All this the prince saw: so the prince went home without being seen; and when their only child came back in the evening the prince called their only child aside, and asked their only child why their only child did so: but their only child burst into tears, and said, ‘That their only child must not tell the prince or any man, or their only child shall lose their only child's life.’ But the prince begged so hard, that their only child had no peace till their only child had told the prince all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very lucky for their only child that their only child did so, for when their only child had done the prince ordered royal clothes to be put upon their only child, and gazed on their only child with wonder, their only child was so beautiful. Then the prince called the prince's son and told his son that the prince had their only child; for their only child their only child was merely a waiting-maid, while their only child stood by. And the prince rejoiced when the prince saw their only child's beauty, and heard how meek and patient their only child had been; and without saying anything to their only child, the prince ordered a great feast to be got ready for all the prince's court. a prince who lived a great way off sat at the top, with their only child on one side, and their only child on the other; but nobody knew their only child again, for their only child's beauty was quite dazzling to nobody's eyes; and their only child did not seem at all like their only child, now that their only child had their only child's brilliant dress on. When all his court had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the prince said the prince would tell all his court a tale. So the prince began, and told all the story of their only child, as if all the story of the princess was one that the prince had once heard; and the prince asked their only child what their only child thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said their only child, ‘than that their only child should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and should drag a cask stuck round with sharp nails from street to street till their only child was dead.’ ‘their only child art their only child!’ said the prince; ‘and as their only child has judged their only child, so shall it be done to their only child.’ And the prince was then married to the prince's , and they reigned over his country in peace and happiness all they's lives; and a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her came to see they, and restored Falada to life again.","[[[0, 5], [10, 10]], [[16, 18], [20, 21], [32, 32], [35, 35], [43, 43], [57, 58], [62, 62], [67, 67], [70, 70], [74, 74], [94, 94], [99, 99], [106, 106], [115, 115], [152, 152], [160, 160],

14,THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET," 1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS ‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet, ‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can, before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’ So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now, duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good pace. After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’ and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet’s toes. Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily. Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach. An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him. ‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks. 2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together; so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage, and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,  ‘All on our way   A visit to pay   To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’ Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’  ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,   Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!   Now, mice, be ready,   And, wheels, run steady!   For we are going a visit to pay   To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’ Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with them. When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself up in the towel. When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot. 3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any more. Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my Partlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse. So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across, and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned. Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her. Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead."," 1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS ‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to Chanticleer's wife Partlet, ‘suppose THEY go together to THE MOUNTAINS, and eat as many as THEY can, before the squirrel takes The nuts away.’ ‘With all his wife Partlet's heart,’ said his wife Partlet, ‘let THEY go and make a holiday of it together.’ So THEY went to THE MOUNTAINS; and as it was a lovely day, THEY stayed there till the evening. Now, whether it was that THEY had eaten so many nuts that THEY could not walk, or whether THEY were lazy and would not, I do not know: however, THEY took it into THEY's heads that it did not become THEY to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when a little carriage of nutshells was finished, his wife Partlet jumped into a little carriage of nutshells and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness Chanticleer to a little carriage of nutshells and draw his wife Partlet's home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, That will never do; Chanticleer had rather by half walk home; Chanticleer’ll sit on the box and be coachman, if his wife Partlet like, but Chanticleer’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have You thieving vagabonds in a duck's grounds? a duck’ll give it You thieving vagabonds well for You thieving vagabonds's insolence!’ and upon that a duck fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned a duck's blows with Chanticleer's sharp spurs so fiercely that a duck soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted a duck upon condition that a duck would draw a little carriage of nutshells home for THEY. draw a duck agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now, a duck, get on as fast as a duck can.’ And away THEY went at a pretty good pace. After THEY had travelled along a little way, THEY met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and a needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’ and said it was so dark that a needle and a pin walking together along the road could hardly find a needle and a pin walking together along the road's way, and such dirty walking a needle and a pin walking together along the road could not get on at all: a needle told a needle and a pin walking together along the road that a needle and a pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till he and his friend, the pin had forgotten how late it was; a needle begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give a needle and a pin walking together along the road a lift in a needle and a pin walking together along the road's carriage. Chanticleer observing that a needle and a pin walking together along the road were but thin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told a needle and a pin walking together along the road a needle and a pin walking together along the road might ride, but made a needle and a pin walking together along the road promise not to dirty the wheels of their carriage in getting in, nor to tread on his wife Partlet's toes. Late at night a needle and a pin walking together along the road arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark, and a duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other, a needle and a pin walking together along the road made up a needle and a pin walking together along the road's minds to fix a needle and a pin walking together along the road's quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said the landlord's house was full, thinking a needle and a pin walking together along the road might not be very respectable company: however, a needle and a pin walking together along the road spoke civilly to the landlord, and gave the landlord the egg which his wife Partlet had laid by the way, and said a needle and a pin walking together along the road would give the landlord a duck: so at last the landlord let a needle and a pin walking together along the road come in, and a needle and a pin walking together along the road bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily. Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was stirring in an inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife Partlet, and, fetching the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, a needle and a pin walking together along the road pecked a hole in the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, ate the egg which Partlet had laid by the way up, and threw the shells into the fireplace: a needle and a pin walking together along the road then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and seizing the pin and needle, who were fast asleep by the heads, stuck one into the landlord's easy chair and the other into the landlord's handkerchief; and, having done this, a needle and a pin walking together along the road crept away as softly as possible. However, a duck, heard a needle and a pin walking together along the road coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by an inn, soon swam out of a needle and a pin walking together along the road's reach. An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief to wipe the landlord's face, but a pin ran into the landlord and pricked the landlord: then the landlord walked into the kitchen to light the landlord's pipe at the fire, but when the landlord stirred his pipe up the eggshells flew into the landlord's eyes, and almost blinded the landlord. ‘Bless the landlord!’ said the landlord, ‘all the world seems to have a design against the landlord's head this morning’: and so saying, the landlord threw the landlord sulkily into the landlord’s easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into the landlord; and this time the pain was not in my head. the landlord now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, the landlord went to look after the company who had come in the night before, but the company who had come in the night before were all off; so the landlord swore that the landlord never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave the landlord nothing for the landlord's trouble but the company who had come in the night before's apish tricks. 2. HOW THEY his wife Partlet WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES Another day, THEY his wife Partlet wished to ride out together; so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed six mice to a handsome carriage with four red wheels; and then THEY his wife Partlet got into a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and away THEY drove. Soon afterwards a cat met THEY, and said, ‘Where are THEY going?’ And Chanticleer replied,  ‘All on THEY's way   A visit to pay   To MR KORBES, today.’ Then a cat said, ‘Take a cat with THEY,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all Chanticleer's heart: get up behind, and be sure a cat do not fall off.’  ‘Take care of a handsome carriage with four red wheels,   Nor dirty four red wheels so fine!   Now, six mice, be ready,   And, wheels, run steady!   For THEY are going a visit to pay   To MR KORBES, today.’ Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and Chanticleer gave a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin leave to get into a handsome carriage with four red wheels and go with THEY. When THEY arrived at his house, MR KORBES was not at home; so six mice drew a handsome carriage with four red wheels into the coach-house, THEY flew upon a beam, a cat sat down in the fireplace, a duck got into the washing cistern, a pin stuck a pin into the bed pillow, a millstone laid a millstone over the house door, and an egg rolled an egg up in the towel. When MR KORBES came home, MR KORBES went to the fireplace to make a fire; but a cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so MR KORBES ran to the kitchen to wash MR KORBES; but there a duck splashed all the water in MR KORBES's face; and when MR KORBES tried to wipe MR KORBES, an egg broke to pieces in the towel all over MR KORBES's face and eyes. Then MR KORBES was very angry, and went without MR KORBES's supper to bed; but when MR KORBES laid MR KORBES's head on the pillow, a pin ran into MR KORBES's cheek: at this MR KORBES became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of his house; but when MR KORBES came to the house door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed MR KORBES on the spot. 3. HOW his wife Partlet DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW Chanticleer DIED OF GRIEF Another day THEY his wife Partlet agreed to go again to THE MOUNTAINS to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which THEY found should be shared equally between THEY. Now his wife Partlet found a very large nut; but his wife Partlet said nothing about a very large nut to Chanticleer, and kept it all to his wife Partlet: however, a very large nut was so big that his wife Partlet could not swallow a very large nut, and a very large nut stuck in his wife Partlet's throat. Then his wife Partlet was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as Chanticleer can, and fetch his wife Partlet some water, or his wife Partlet shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as Chanticleer could to the river, and said, ‘the river, give Chanticleer some water, for his wife Partlet lies in the mountain, and will be choked by a very large nut.’ the river said, ‘Run first to the bride, and ask the bride for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, ‘the bride, the bride must give Chanticleer a silken cord, for then the river will give Chanticleer water, and the water Chanticleer will carry to his wife Partletthe mountaina very large nut.’ But the bride said, ‘Run first, and bring the bride the bride's garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden from the bough where my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden hung, and brought my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden to the bride; and then the bride gave Chanticleer a silken cord, and Chanticleer took a silken cord to the river, and the river gave Chanticleer water, and Chanticleer carried water to his wife Partlet; but in the meantime his wife Partlet was choked by a very large nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any more. Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with Chanticleer over his wife Partlet. And six mice built a little hearse to carry his wife Partlet to his wife Partlet's grave; and when a little hearse to carry her to her grave was ready six mice harnessed six mice before a little hearse to carry her to her grave, and Chanticleer drove six mice. On the way six mice met the fox. ‘Where are Chanticleer going, Chanticleer?’ said the fox. ‘To bury the fox's ,’ said the other. ‘May the other go with six mice?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but the fox must get up behind, or Chanticleer's horses will not be able to draw six mice.’ Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon a little hearse to carry her to her grave. So on THEY went till THEY came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall THEY get over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘a straw will lay a straw across, and six mice may pass over upon a straw.’ But as six mice were going over, a straw slipped away and fell into the water, and six mice fell in and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came and said, ‘a large log of wood am big enough; a large log of wood will lay a large log of wood across a rapid stream, and six mice shall pass over upon a large log of wood.’ So a large log of wood laid a large log of wood down; but six mice managed so clumsily, that a large log of wood fell in and was carried away by a rapid stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help Chanticleer by laying a stone, who saw what had happened across a rapid stream; and this time a stone, who saw what had happened got safely to the other side with a little hearse to carry her to her grave, and managed to get his wife Partlet out of a little hearse to carry her to her grave; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by a rapid stream and drowned. Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his wife Partlet; and having dug a grave for his wife Partlet, Chanticleer laid his wife Partlet in a grave, and made a little hillock over his wife Partlet. Then Chanticleer sat down by a grave, and wept and mourned, till at last Chanticleer died too; and so all were dead.","[[[22, 22], [24, 24], [152, 152], [178, 178], [180, 180], [197, 197], [207, 207],

15,RAPUNZEL,"There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’ At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’ ‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her. Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried:  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,   Let down your hair to me.’ Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it. After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,   Let down your hair to me.’ Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,   Let down your hair to me.’ Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up. At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he is with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress. ‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery. On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king’s son came and cried:  ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,   Let down your hair to me.’ she let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.","There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.

Two of Rapunzel's tears wetted his eyes and his eyes grew clear again, and the king’s son could see with his eyes as before. the king’s son led Rapunzel to the king’s son's kingdom where the king’s son was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.","[[[6, 7], [20, 21], [29, 29], [104, 105], [119, 119], [143, 143], [148, 148], [162, 162], [173, 173], [175, 176], [183, 183], [188, 188], [206, 206], [216, 216], [224, 225], [229, 229], [271, 272], [274, 274], [278, 278], [294, 294], [304, 304], [323, 323], [430, 431], [447, 447], [452, 452], [514, 515], [550, 551]], [[3, 16], [32, 33], [42, 42], [203, 203]], [[46, 48], [64, 64], [82, 82], [84, 84], [115, 116], [200, 204], [254, 258], [330, 331], [384, 385]], [[35, 43], [109, 110], [436, 437]], [[121, 133], [136, 136]], [[127, 133], [146, 146], [194, 204], [232, 233], [265, 265], [282, 282], [286, 286], [289, 289], [307, 307], [388, 389], [433, 434], [445, 445]], [[3, 4], [162, 163], [211, 216], [224, 224], [234, 234], [247, 247], [271, 271], [316, 316], [323, 324], [340, 340], [342, 342], [348, 348], [354, 354], [360, 360], [366, 366], [371, 371], [394, 394], [406, 406], [417, 417], [421, 421], [430, 430], [474, 474], [482, 482], [488, 488], [493, 493], [498, 498], [507, 507], [514, 514], [539, 540], [542, 542]], [[42, 43], [203, 204]], [[230, 233], [237, 237], [240, 240]], [[71, 73], [251, 252], [352, 353]], [[87, 100], [257, 258], [362, 363], [376, 376], [384, 384], [388, 388], [433, 433], [462, 463], [465, 465], [485, 485], [501, 502], [502, 502], [510, 510], [529, 529], [557, 558], [576, 576], [596, 597], [628, 629], [635, 635], [637, 637], [655, 655], [676, 677], [706, 707], [841, 842], [850, 850], [865, 865], [879, 880], [939, 939], [1061, 1063], [1157, 1159], [1164, 1165], [1176, 1176], [1182, 1183], [1189, 1189], [1224, 1225], [1230, 1230], [1235, 1235], [1237, 1237], [1251, 1251], [1255, 1255], [1257, 1257], [1268, 1268], [1301, 1301], [1306, 1306], [1314, 1314], [1329, 1329], [1336, 1337], [1345, 1345], [1404, 1415], [1421, 1421]], [[262, 265], [269, 269]], [[387, 387], [398, 398]], [[511, 520], [522, 522], [533, 533], [564, 565], [573, 573]], [[578, 578], [590, 590], [599, 599], [645, 645], [647, 647], [652, 652], [658, 658], [671, 671], [678, 678], [680, 680], [757, 771], [761, 761], [764, 764], [768, 768], [782, 782], [855, 855], [857, 857], [862, 862], [869, 869], [875, 875], [884, 884], [929, 929], [931, 931], [936, 936], [957, 957], [967, 967], [976, 976], [987, 987], [995, 995], [1019, 1019], [1022, 1022], [1024, 1024], [1031, 1031], [1033, 1033], [1038, 1038], [1042, 1042], [1051, 1051], [1058, 1058], [1068, 1068], [1074, 1074], [1079, 1079], [1083, 1083], [1092, 1092], [1115, 1115], [1128, 1128], [1136, 1136], [1152, 1152], [1173, 1173], [1180, 1180], [1195, 1195], [1209, 1209], [1218, 1220], [1232, 1232], [1240, 1240], [1248, 1248], [1259, 1260], [1308, 1309], [1332, 1332], [1369, 1369], [1371, 1371], [1376, 1376], [1382, 1382], [1398, 1400], [1429, 1430], [1433, 1435], [1448, 1448], [1459, 1459], [1469, 1469], [1538, 1540], [1560, 1560], [1567, 1567], [1605, 1605], [1618, 1618], [1640, 1640]], [[623, 625], [639, 639], [692, 694]], [[680, 682], [685, 685], [698, 699], [711, 711], [872, 876], [1259, 1262], [1265, 1265], [1286, 1286], [1292, 1294], [1339, 1348]], [[607, 608], [730, 731], [821, 822], [1517, 1518]], [[601, 615], [735, 736], [790, 791], [922, 923], [1491, 1492]], [[724, 727], [739, 739], [749, 749], [773, 776], [800, 800], [811, 811], [817, 817], [830, 830], [838, 838], [847, 847], [897, 897], [901, 901], [906, 906], [919, 919], [948, 951], [979, 982], [997, 997], [1007, 1007], [1013, 1013], [1029, 1029], [1036, 1036], [1045, 1045], [1055, 1055], [1077, 1077], [1089, 1089], [1103, 1103], [1111, 1111], [1133, 1133], [1138, 1138], [1148, 1148], [1200, 1204], [1206, 1206], [1359, 1362], [1379, 1379], [1388, 1391], [1398, 1398], [1402, 1402], [1410, 1410], [1426, 1426], [1429, 1429], [1454, 1454], [1463, 1463], [1465, 1465], [1473, 1476], [1479, 1479], [1485, 1485], [1487, 1487], [1494, 1494], [1497, 1497], [1505, 1505], [1508, 1508], [1512, 1512], [1538, 1538], [1543, 1543], [1582, 1582], [1593, 1593], [1595, 1595], [1602, 1602], [1607, 1607], [1611, 1611], [1621, 1621], [1630, 1630], [1638, 1638], [1642, 1642], [1645, 1645]], [[741, 753], [755, 755], [805, 806], [826, 826]], [[673, 677], [768, 770]], [[652, 653], [862, 863], [875, 876], [936, 937], [943, 944], [1376, 1377], [1384, 1385]], [[724, 726], [948, 950], [979, 981], [1200, 1203], [1359, 1361], [1388, 1390], [1473, 1475]], [[997, 998], [1004, 1004]], [[1104, 1107], [1121, 1121]], [[1118, 1119], [1125, 1125]], [[465, 466], [1255, 1256]], [[1584, 1585], [1588, 1588], [1598, 1598]], [[1508, 1509], [1621, 1622], [1624, 1624], [1634, 1634]]]"
16,FUNDEVOGEL,"There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree. The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself: ‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad. Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you fetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’ Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel: ‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’ The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be followed instantly to get them back again.’ Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but the children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance. Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in it. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them; so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however, saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling after them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.","There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as a forester who went into the forest to hunt entered the forest a forester who went into the forest to hunt heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there. a forester who went into the forest to hunt followed a sound of screaming as if a little child were there, and at last came to a high tree, and at the top of a high tree a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under a high tree with a little child, and a bird of prey had seen a little child in the mother's arms, had flown down, snatched a little child away, and set a little child on a high tree. a forester who went into the forest to hunt climbed up, brought a little child down, and thought to a forester who went into the forest to hunt: ‘You will take a little child home with a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and bring a little child up with a forester who went into the forest to hunt's Lina.’ a forester who went into the forest to hunt took a little child home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And a little child was called Fundevogel, because a bird had carried a little child away. the two children your Lina loved each other so dearly that when the two children did not see each other the two children were sad. Now a forester who went into the forest to hunt had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to the spring. your Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, why are an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water fetching so much water?’ ‘If your Lina will never repeat it to anyone, an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water will tell your Lina why.’ So your Lina said, no, your Lina would never repeat it to anyone, and then an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when a forester who went into the forest to hunt is out hunting, an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water will heat the water, and when the water is boiling in the kettle, an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil Fundevogel in the kettle.’ Early tomorrow morning a forester who went into the forest to hunt got up and went out hunting, and when a forester who went into the forest to hunt was gone the children were still in bed. Then your Lina said to Fundevogel: ‘If Fundevogel will never leave your Lina, I too will never leave Fundevogel.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will Fundevogel leave your Lina.’ Then said your Lina: ‘Then will your Lina tell Fundevogel. Last night, an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water carried so many buckets of water into the house that your Lina asked an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water why an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water was doing carried, and an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water said that if your Lina would promise not to tell anyone, and an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water said that early tomorrow morning when a forester who went into the forest to hunt was out hunting, an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water would set the kettle full of water, throw Fundevogel into the kettle and boil Fundevogel; but we will get up quickly, dress we, and go away together.’ the two children therefore got up, dressed the two children quickly, and went away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water went into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw Fundevogel into the kettle. But when an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water came in, and went to the beds, the two children were gone. Then an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water was terribly alarmed, and an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water said to an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water: ‘What shall an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water say now when a forester who went into the forest to hunt comes home and sees that the two children are gone? the two children must be followed instantly to get the two children back again.’ Then an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water sent three servants after the two children, who were to run and overtake the two children. the children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and when the children saw from afar three servants running, your Lina said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave your Lina, and your Lina will never leave Fundevogel.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said your Lina: ‘Do Fundevogel become a rose-tree, and your Lina the rose upon a rose-tree.’ When three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on a rose-tree, but the children were nowhere.

Then said your Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave your Lina, and your Lina will never leave Fundevogel.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Said your Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and your Lina will be the duck upon a fishpond.’ an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, however, came up to the children, and when an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water saw the pond an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water lay down by the pond, and was about to drink the pond up. But the duck upon it swam quickly to an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, seized an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water's head in the duck upon it's beak and drew an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water into the water, and there an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if the children have not died, the children are living still.","[[[3, 11], [15, 15], [18, 18], [32, 32], [99, 100], [112, 112], [121, 121], [128, 128], [132, 132], [152, 152], [191, 192], [290, 291], [328, 329], [339, 339], [442, 442], [556, 557]], [[8, 9], [17, 17], [606, 607], [676, 677], [727, 728]], [[20, 30], [34, 35]], [[42, 44], [51, 51], [65, 66], [95, 97]], [[52, 54], [68, 69], [78, 78], [88, 88], [93, 93], [105, 106], [118, 118], [125, 125], [134, 134], [148, 157], [167, 167]], [[59, 60], [80, 80]], [[140, 142], [170, 172], [180, 180], [186, 186], [480, 482], [488, 488], [531, 533], [563, 564], [568, 568], [575, 575], [587, 587], [595, 596]], [[128, 129], [172, 172], [226, 226], [249, 249], [260, 260], [265, 265], [270, 270], [350, 350], [361, 361], [383, 383], [388, 388], [393, 393], [412, 412], [426, 426], [620, 620], [628, 628], [631, 631], [651, 651], [663, 663], [812, 812], [820, 820], [823, 823], [842, 842], [853, 853], [1016, 1016], [1023, 1023], [1026, 1026], [1046, 1046], [1054, 1054]], [[194, 208], [235, 236], [240, 240], [257, 257], [280, 281], [296, 296], [311, 311], [400, 401], [414, 414], [416, 416], [422, 422], [435, 435], [447, 447], [504, 505], [521, 521], [538, 538], [544, 544], [547, 547], [552, 552], [581, 582], [719, 720], [742, 744], [907, 908], [939, 940], [971, 974], [977, 977], [1008, 1009], [1063, 1064], [1075, 1075], [1079, 1079], [1099, 1099], [1102, 1102], [1109, 1109], [1116, 1118]], [[253, 253], [274, 274]], [[299, 300], [304, 304]], [[170, 170], [315, 315], [320, 320], [353, 353], [357, 357], [368, 368], [371, 371], [381, 381], [395, 395], [457, 457], [462, 462], [512, 512], [515, 515], [623, 623], [635, 635], [638, 638], [655, 655], [816, 816], [827, 827], [830, 830], [847, 847], [1019, 1019], [1030, 1030], [1035, 1035]], [[308, 309], [322, 322], [450, 451], [459, 459], [499, 500], [517, 517]], [[285, 287], [325, 327]], [[402, 402], [419, 419]], [[465, 465], [472, 472]], [[342, 343], [598, 599], [611, 611], [694, 695], [799, 800], [915, 915], [989, 990], [992, 993], [1071, 1071], [1124, 1125], [1137, 1137], [1142, 1142]], [[584, 585], [615, 617], [671, 673], [701, 701], [714, 714], [722, 722], [750, 751], [753, 753], [775, 775], [786, 786], [805, 805], [864, 866], [882, 882], [892, 892], [897, 897], [903, 903], [911, 911], [918, 918], [922, 922], [942, 942], [947, 948], [952, 952], [966, 966], [983, 985], [1001, 1003], [1012, 1012]], [[657, 660], [667, 667]], [[683, 686], [691, 691]], [[730, 739], [739, 739], [757, 760]], [[736, 737], [768, 769], [772, 772]], [[849, 850], [859, 859], [873, 880], [880, 880], [927, 928], [936, 936], [955, 956]], [[877, 878], [933, 934], [962, 963]], [[1050, 1051], [1060, 1060]], [[1077, 1078], [1083, 1083], [1090, 1090]], [[1057, 1060], [1094, 1095], [1105, 1105]]]"
17,THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR,"One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams, cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health and strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t taste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however, who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that sort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole town shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away, he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him, and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck. Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’ ‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is that all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better, wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you, comrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant, ‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if carrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry the tree!’ They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no lack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand. The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much more spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into a corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified, they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a great hurry. The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose. After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and read on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty lord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have I come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s service.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling was assigned him. The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished him a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said among themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him, seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against him.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to the king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said they, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him. ‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the little tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.’ The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers: ‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you knocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is a lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not wounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about that,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees. The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however, repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get rid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my kingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch it first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as that,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king. The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their help. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a king was made. After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at night: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her and said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer, who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of the whole plot. ‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing outside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his life.","One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on a little tailor's table by the window; a little tailor was in good spirits, and sewed with all a little tailor's might. Then came a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams, cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in a little tailor ears; a little tailor stretched a little tailor's delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, a peasant woman down the street; here a peasant woman down the street will get rid of a peasant woman down the street's goods.’ a peasant woman down the street came up the three steps to a little tailor with a peasant woman down the street's heavy basket, and a little tailor made a peasant woman down the street unpack all the pots for a little tailor. a little tailor inspected each one, lifted each one up, put a little tailor's nose to each one, and at length said: ‘The jam seems to a little tailor to be good, so weigh a little tailor out four ounces, a peasant woman down the street, and if it is a quarter of a pound is is of no consequence.’ a peasant woman down the street, gave a little tailor what a little tailor desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, The jam shall be blessed by God,’ cried a little tailor, ‘and give a little tailor health and strength’; so a little tailor brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut a little tailor a piece right across the bread and spread The jam over the bread. ‘the bread won’t taste bitter,’ said a little tailor, ‘but a little tailor will just finish the jacket before a little tailor take a bite.’ a little tailor laid the bread near a little tailor, sewed on, and in a little tailor's joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of The jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and the flies were attracted and descended on The jam in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited the flies?’ said a little tailor, and drove the flies away. The flies, however, who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies. a little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under a little tailor's work-table, and saying: ‘Wait, and a little tailor will give a piece of cloth to the flies,’ struck a piece of cloth mercilessly on the flies. When a little tailor drew a piece of cloth away and counted, there lay before a little tailor no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are the flies a fellow of that sort?’ said a little tailor, and could not help admiring a little tailor's own bravery. ‘The whole town shall know of this!’ And a little tailor hastened to cut a little tailor a girdle, stitched a girdle, and embroidered on a girdle in large letters: ‘Seven at one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ a little tailor continued, ‘The whole town shall hear of this!’ and a little tailor's heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. a little tailor put on a girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because a little tailor thought a little tailor's workshop was too small for a little tailor's valour.

You miserable creature!’ ‘Oh, indeed?’ answered a little tailor, and unbuttoned a little tailor's coat, and showed a powerful giant looking peacefully about him a girdle, ‘there may a powerful giant looking peacefully about him read what kind of a man a little tailor am!’ a powerful giant looking peacefully about him read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had been men whom a little tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for a little tailor. Nevertheless, a powerful giant looking peacefully about him wished to try a little tailor first, and took a stone in a powerful giant looking peacefully about him's hand and squeezed a stone together so that water dropped out of a stone. ‘Do that likewise,’ said a powerful giant looking peacefully about him, ‘if a little tailor have strength.’ ‘Is that all?’ said a little tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put a little tailor's hand into his pocket, brought out an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket, and pressed an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket until the liquid ran out of an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. ‘Faith,’ said a little tailor, ‘that was a little better, wasn’t that?’ a powerful giant looking peacefully about him did not know what to say, and could not believe it of a little tailor. Then a powerful giant looking peacefully about him picked up a stone and threw a stone so high that the eye could scarcely follow a stone. ‘Now, a little tailor, do that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said a little tailor, ‘but after all a stone came down to earth again; a little tailor will throw a powerful giant looking peacefully about him one which shall never come back at all,’ and a little tailor put a little tailor's hand into a little tailor's pocket, took out one which shall never come back at all, and threw one which shall never come back at all into the air. one which shall never come back at all, delighted with one which shall never come back at all's liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please a powerful giant looking peacefully about him, a powerful giant looking peacefully about him?’ asked a little tailor. ‘a little tailor can certainly throw,’ said a powerful giant looking peacefully about him, ‘but now we will see if a little tailor are able to carry anything properly.’ a powerful giant looking peacefully about him took a little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: ‘If a little tailor are strong enough, help a powerful giant looking peacefully about him to carry a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered a little tailor; ‘take a powerful giant looking peacefully about him a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground on a powerful giant looking peacefully about him's shoulders, and a little tailor will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, the branches and twigs are the heaviest.’ a powerful giant looking peacefully about him took a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground on your shoulders, but a little tailor seated a little tailor on a branch, and a powerful giant looking peacefully about him had to carry away a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and a little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if carrying a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground were child’s play. a powerful giant looking peacefully about him, after a powerful giant looking peacefully about him had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark a little tailor, a powerful giant looking peacefully about him shall have to let a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground fall!’ a little tailor sprang nimbly down, seized a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground with both arms as if a little tailor had been carrying a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said to a powerful giant looking peacefully about him: ‘a powerful giant looking peacefully about him are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground!’ They went on together, and as They passed a cherry-tree, a powerful giant looking peacefully about him laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging down, gave the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging into a little tailor hand, and bade a little tailor eat. But a little tailor was much too weak to hold a cherry-tree, and when a powerful giant looking peacefully about him let a cherry-tree go, a cherry-tree sprang back again, and a little tailor was tossed into the air with a cherry-tree. When a little tailor had fallen down again without injury, a powerful giant looking peacefully about him said: ‘What is this? Have a little tailor not strength enough to hold an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket?’ ‘There is no lack of strength,’ answered a little tailor. ‘Do a powerful giant looking peacefully about him think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? a little tailor leapt over a cherry-tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. Jump as a little tailor did, if a powerful giant looking peacefully about him can do Jump.’ a powerful giant looking peacefully about him made Jump but a powerful giant looking peacefully about him could not get over a cherry-tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also a little tailor kept the upper hand. a powerful giant looking peacefully about him said: ‘If a little tailor are such a valiant fellow, come with a powerful giant looking peacefully about him into our cavern and spend the night with our.’ a little tailor was willing, and followed a powerful giant looking peacefully about him. When They went into our cavern, other giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of other giants had a roasted sheep in each of them's hand and was eating a roasted sheep. a little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much more spacious here than in his workshop.’ a powerful giant looking peacefully about him showed a little tailor a bed, and said a little tailor was to lie down in a bed and sleep. a bed, however, was too big for a little tailor; a little tailor did not lie down in a bed, but crept into a corner. When it was midnight, and a powerful giant looking peacefully about him thought that a little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, a powerful giant looking peacefully about him got up, took a great iron bar, cut through a bed with one blow, and thought a powerful giant looking peacefully about him had finished off the grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn other giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten a little tailor, when all at once a little tailor walked up to other giants quite merrily and boldly. other giants were terrified, other giants were afraid that a little tailor would strike other giants dead, and ran away in a great hurry. a little tailor went onwards, always following a little tailor's own pointed nose. After a little tailor had walked for a long time, a little tailor came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and as a little tailor felt weary, a little tailor lay down on the grass and fell asleep. Whilst a little tailor lay there, the people came and inspected a little tailor on all sides, and read on a little tailor's girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said the people, ‘what does a little tailor want here in the midst of peace? a little tailor must be a mighty lord.’ the people went and announced a little tailor to the king, and gave it as the people's opinion that if war should break out, a little tailor would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased the king, and the king sent one of the king's courtiers to a little tailor to offer a little tailor military service when a little tailor awoke. one of his courtiers remained standing by a little tailor, waited until a little tailor stretched a little tailor's limbs and opened a little tailor's eyes, and then conveyed to a little tailor offer. ‘For this very reason have a little tailor come here,’ a little tailor replied, ‘a little tailor am ready to enter the king's service.’ a little tailor was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling was assigned a little tailor. The soldiers, however, were set against a little tailor, and wished a little tailor a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ The soldiers said among The soldiers. ‘If The soldiers quarrel with a little tailor, and a little tailor strikes about a little tailor, seven of The soldiers will fall at every blow; not one of The soldiers can stand against a little tailor.’ The soldiers came therefore to a decision, betook The soldiers in a body to the king, and begged for The soldiers's dismissal. ‘The soldiers are not prepared,’ said The soldiers, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ the king was sorry that for the sake of one the king should lose The soldiers, wished that the king had never set eyes on a little tailor, and would willingly have been rid of a little tailor again. But the king did not venture to give a little tailor their dismissal, for the king dreaded lest the king should strike a little tailor and all the king's people dead, and place the king on the royal throne. the king thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel. the king sent to a little tailor and caused a little tailor to be informed that as a little tailor was a great warrior, the king had one request to make to a little tailor. In a forest of a little tailor's country lived two giants, who caused great mischief with two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning's robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning without putting no one in danger of death. If a little tailor conquered and killed two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, a little tailor would give a little tailor a little tailor's only daughter to wife, and half of a little tailor's kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with a little tailor to assist a little tailor. ‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like a little tailor!’ thought a little tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ a little tailor replied, ‘a little tailor will soon subdue two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and do not require the help of one hundred horsemen to do subdue; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.’ a little tailor went forth, and one hundred horsemen followed a little tailor. When a little tailor came to the outskirts of the forest, a little tailor said to one hundred horsemen: ‘Just stay waiting here, a little tailor will soon finish off two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning.’ Then a little tailor bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a while a little tailor perceived two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning. two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down. a little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with two pocketsful of stones climbed up a tree. When a little tailor was halfway up, a little tailor slipped down by a branch, until a little tailor sat just above two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning. For a long time one of the giants felt nothing, but at last one of the giants awoke, pushed one of the giants's comrade, and said: ‘Why are his comrade knocking one of the giants?’ ‘one of the giants must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘the other am not knocking one of the giants.’ two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning laid two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning down to sleep again, and then a little tailor threw a stone down on the other. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried the other ‘Why are a little tailor pelting the other?’ ‘a little tailor am not pelting the other,’ answered a little tailor, growling. two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning disputed about it for a time, but as two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning were weary two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning let the matter rest, and two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning's eyes closed once more. a little tailor began a little tailor's game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw the biggest stone with all a little tailor's might on the breast of one of the giants. ‘That is too bad!’ cried a little tailor, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed one of the giants against a tree until a tree shook. the other paid a little tailor back in the same coin, and two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning got into such a rage that two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then a little tailor leapt down. ‘It is a lucky thing,’ said a little tailor, ‘that two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning did not tear up a tree, or a little tailor should have had to sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ a little tailor drew out a little tailor's sword and gave each of one hundred horsemen a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; a little tailor have finished two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning off, but it was hard work! two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning tore up trees in two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning's sore need, and defended two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning with trees, but all that is to no purpose when a man like a little tailor comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are a little tailor not wounded?’ asked one hundred horsemen. ‘one hundred horsemen need not concern one hundred horsemen about are,’ answered a little tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of a little tailor.’ one hundred horsemen would not believe a little tailor, and rode into the forest; there one hundred horsemen found two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning swimming in two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning's blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees. a little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; the king, however, repented of the king's promise, and again bethought the king how the king could get rid of a little tailor. ‘Before a little tailor receive his only daughter, and half of his kingdomhis kingdom,’ said the king to a little tailor, ‘a little tailor must perform one more heroic deed. In the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and a little tailor must catch a unicorn which does great harm first.’ ‘a little tailor fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one blow, is a little tailor's kind of affair.’ a little tailor took a rope and an axe with a little tailor, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with a little tailor to wait outside. a little tailor had not long to seek. a unicorn which does great harm soon came towards a little tailor, and rushed directly on a little tailor, as if a unicorn which does great harm would gore a little tailor with a unicorn which does great harm's horn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as that,’ said a little tailor, and stood still and waited until a unicorn which does great harm was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. a unicorn which does great harm ran against the tree with all a unicorn which does great harm's strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that a unicorn which does great harm had not the strength enough to draw its horn out again, and thus a unicorn which does great harm was caught. ‘Now, a little tailor have got one which shall never come back at all,’ said a little tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put a rope round one which shall never come back at all's neck, and then with an axe a little tailor hewed its horn out of the tree, and when all was ready a little tailor led a unicorn which does great harm away and took a unicorn which does great harm to the king. the king still would not give a little tailor the promised reward, and made a third demand. Before the wedding a little tailor was to catch the king a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give a little tailor the huntsmen's help. ‘Willingly,’ said a little tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ a little tailor did not take the huntsmen with a little tailor into the forest, and the huntsmen were well pleased that a little tailor did not, for a unicorn which does great harm had several times received the huntsmen in such a manner that the huntsmen had no inclination to lie in wait for a little tailor. When a unicorn which does great harm perceived a little tailor, a unicorn which does great harm ran on a little tailor with foaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw a little tailor to the ground, but a little tailor fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again. a unicorn which does great harm ran after a little tailor, but a little tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind a unicorn which does great harm, and then a unicorn which does great harmthe window, was caught. a little tailor called the huntsmen thither that the huntsmen might see a little tailor with the huntsmen's own eyes. a little tailor, however, went to the kingthe king the king's , and gave his only daughter and half of his kingdomhis kingdom. Had the king known that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before the king, it would have gone to the king's heart still more than it did. the wedding was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a king was made. After some time his only daughter heard his only daughter's husband say in her husband's dreams at night: ‘Boy, make her husband the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else her husband will rap the yard-measure over Boy's ears.’ Then his only daughter discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained of his only daughter's wrongs to his only daughter's , and begged the king to help his only daughter to get rid of her husband. the king comforted his only daughter and said: ‘Leave his only daughter's bedroom door open this night, and the king's servants shall stand outside, and when her husband has fallen asleep shall go in, bind her husband, and take her husband on board a ship which shall carry her husband into the wide world.’ his only daughter was satisfied with this; but the king armour-bearer, who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed the young lord of the whole plot. ‘a little tailor’ll put a screw into that business,’ said a little tailor. At night a little tailor went to bed with his only daughter at the usual time, and when his only daughter thought that a little tailor had fallen asleep, his only daughter got up, opened the door, and then lay down again. a little tailor, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make a little tailor the doublet and patch a little tailor the pantaloons, or a little tailor will rap the yard-measure over your ears. a little tailor smote seven at one blow. a little tailor killed two giants, a little tailor brought away one unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am a little tailor to fear those who are standing outside the room.’ When Boy heard a little tailor speaking thus, Boy were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if a little tailor were behind Boy, and none of Boy would venture anything further against a little tailor. So a little tailor was and remained a king to the end of a little tailor's life.","[[[4, 6], [10, 10], [16, 16], [26, 26], [55, 57], [60, 60], [62, 62], [99, 100], [107, 107], [115, 115], [117, 117],

18,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man. The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet, Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: ‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah, father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said: ‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road. When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’ Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone. Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought: ‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also. The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.’ Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. ‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman, ‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:  ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,   Who is nibbling at my little house?’ The children answered:  ‘The wind, the wind,   The heaven-born wind,’ and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven. The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’ Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded. And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then, Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’ said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’ Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman, ‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. ‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death. Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. ‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’ When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she cried:  ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,   Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?   There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,   Take us across on thy back so white.’ The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.","Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with a poor wood-cutter's wife and a poor wood-cutter's two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. a poor wood-cutter had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, a poor wood-cutter could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when a poor wood-cutter thought over this by night in a poor wood-cutter's bed, and tossed about in a poor wood-cutter's anxiety, a poor wood-cutter groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children? How are a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children to feed his two children, when a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children no longer have anything even for a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children?’ ‘his wife’ll tell a poor wood-cutter what, a poor wood-cutter,’ answered his wife, ‘early tomorrow morning a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will take his two children out into a great forest to where a great forest is the thickest; there a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will light a fire for his two children, and give each of his two children one more piece of bread, and then a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will go to a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children's work and leave his two children alone. his two children will not find the way home again, and a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children shall be rid of his two children.’ ‘No, his wife,’ said a poor wood-cutter, ‘a poor wood-cutter will not do that; how can a poor wood-cutter bear to leave his two children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would soon come and tear his two children to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said his wife, ‘then a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children must all four die of hunger, a poor wood-cutter may as well plane the planks for a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children's coffins,’ and his wife left a poor wood-cutter no peace until a poor wood-cutter consented. ‘But a poor wood-cutter feel very sorry for his two children, all the same,’ said a poor wood-cutter. his two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what his two children's had said to his two children's . the girl wept bitter tears, and said to The boy: ‘Now all is over with a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children.’ ‘Be quiet, the girl,’ said The boy, ‘do not distress the girl, The boy will soon find a way to help a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, The boy got up, put on The boy's little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. The boy stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his little coat with as many as The boy could get in. Then The boy went back and said to the girl: ‘Be comforted, the girl, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children,’ and The boy lay down again in The boy's bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, his wife came and awoke his two children, saying: ‘Get up, his two children! a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children are going into a great forest to fetch wood.’ his wife gave each a little piece of bread, and said: ‘There is something for his two children's dinner, but do not eat something for your dinner up before then, for his two children will get nothing else.’ the girl took a little piece of bread under the girl's apron, as The boy had the pebbles in The boy's pocket. Then a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children set out together on the way to a great forest. When a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children had walked a short time, The boy stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. The boy's said: ‘The boy, what are The boy looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use The boy's legs.’ ‘Ah, a poor wood-cutter,’ said The boy, ‘The boy am looking at The boy's little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to The boy.’ his wife said: ‘The boy, my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me is not my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me, my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.’ The boy, however, had not been looking back at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me, but had been constantly throwing one of the pebbles out of his pocket on the road. When a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children had reached the middle of a great forest, a poor wood-cutter said: ‘Now, his two children, pile up some wood, and a poor wood-cutter will light a fire that his two children may not be cold.’ The boy the girl gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, his wife said: ‘Now, his two children, lay his two children down by the fire and rest, a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will go into a great forest and cut some wood. When a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children have done, a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will come back and fetch his two children away.’ his two children sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as his two children heard the strokes of the wood-axe his two children believed that his two children's was near. It was not the wood-axe, however, but a branch which a poor wood-cutter had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as his two children had been sitting such a long time, his two children's eyes closed with fatigue, and his two children fell fast asleep. When at last his two children awoke, it was already dark night. the girl began to cry and said: ‘How are a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children to get out of a great forest now?’ But The boy comforted the girl and said: ‘Just wait a little, until The moon has risen, and then a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will soon find the way.’ And when The moon had risen, The boy took The boy's by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed his two children the way. a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to the house. a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children knocked at the door, and when his wife opened the door and saw that it was The boy the girl, his wife said: ‘his two children, why have his two children slept so long in the forest?--we thought his two children were never coming back at all!’ a poor wood-cutter, however, rejoiced, for it had cut a poor wood-cutter to the heart to leave his two children behind alone. Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and his two children heard his two children's saying at night to his two children's : ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and one half loaf is the end. his two children must go, we will take his two children farther into a great forest, so that his two children will not find his two children's way out again; there is no other means of saving we!’ a poor wood-cutter's heart was heavy, and a poor wood-cutter thought: ‘It would be better for his wife to share the last mouthful with his two children.’ his wife, however, would listen to nothing that a poor wood-cutter had to say, but scolded and reproached a poor wood-cutter. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as a poor wood-cutter had yielded the first time, a poor wood-cutter had to do so a second time also. his two children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, The boy again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as The boy had done before, but his wife had locked the door, and The boy could not get out. Nevertheless The boy comforted The boy's , and said: ‘Do not cry, the girl, go to sleep quietly, God will help a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children.’ Early in the morning came his wife, and took his two children out of his two children's beds. his two children's piece of bread was given to his two children, but Their piece of bread was still smaller than the time before. On the way into a great forest The boy crumbled The boy in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. ‘The boy, why do The boy stop and look round?’ said a poor wood-cutter, ‘go on.’ ‘The boy am looking back at The boy's little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to The boy,’ answered The boy. ‘The boy!’ said his wife, ‘my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof is not my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.’ The boy, however little by little, threw all the crumbs on the road. his wife led his two children still deeper into a great forest. Then a great fire was again made, and his wife said: ‘Just sit there, his two children, and when his two children are tired his two children may sleep a little; a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children are going into a great forest to cut wood, and in the evening when a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children are done, a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will come and fetch his two children away.’ When it was noon, the girl shared Their piece of bread with The boyThe boy's . Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to his two children. his two children did not awake until it was dark night, and The boy comforted The boy's and said: ‘Just wait, the girl, until The moon rises, and then his two children shall see all the crumbs, all the crumbs will show his two children his two children's way home again.’ When The moon came his two children set out, but his two children found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked all the crumbs up. The boy said to the girl: ‘his two children shall soon find the way,’ but his two children did not find the way. his two children walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but his two children did not get out of a great forest, and were very hungry, for his two children had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as his two children were so weary that his two children's legs would carry his two children no longer, his two children lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. It was now three mornings since his two children had left the house. his two children began to walk again, but his two children always came deeper into a great forest, and if help did not come soon, his two children must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, his two children saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that his two children stood still and listened to a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it's song was over, a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it spread a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it's wings and flew away before his two children, and his two children followed a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it until his two children reached a little house, on the roof of which a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it alighted; and when his two children approached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted his two children saw that a little house, on the roof of which it alighted was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. ‘his two children will set to work on that,’ said The boy, ‘and have a good meal. The boy will eat a bit of the roof, and the girl, can eat some of the window, some of the window will taste sweet.’ The boy reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how the roof tasted, and the girl leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:  ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,   Who is nibbling at a little house, on the roof of which it alighted?’ his two children answered:  ‘The wind, The wind,   The wind,’ and went on eating without disturbing his two children. The boythe roof, tore down a great piece of the roof, and the girl pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed the girl with the whole of one round window-pane. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches on crutches, came creeping out. The boy were so terribly frightened that his two children let fall what his two children had in his two children's hands. a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, however, nodded a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's head, and said: ‘Oh, his two children, who has brought his two children here? do come in, and stay with a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches. No harm shall happen to his two children.’ a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches took his two children by the hand, and led his two children into a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's . Then good food was set before his two children, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and The boy lay down in two pretty little beds, and thought his two children were in heaven. a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches had only pretended to be so kind; a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built a little house, on the roof of which it alighted in order to entice children there. When a child fell into a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's power, a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches killed a child, cooked and ate a child, and that was a feast day with a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but Witches have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When The boy the girl came into a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's neighbourhood, a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches laughed with malice, and said mockingly: ‘a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches have his two children, his two children shall not escape a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches again!’ Early in the morning before his two children were awake, a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches was already up, and when a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches saw his two children sleeping and looking so pretty, with his two children's plump and rosy cheeks a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches muttered to a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches: ‘That will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches seized The boy with a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's shrivelled hand, carried The boy into a little stable, and locked The boy in behind a grated door. Scream as The boy might, Scream would not help The boy. Then a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches went to the girl, shook the girl till the girl awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, the girl, fetch some water, and cook something good for The boy, The boy is in a little stable, and is to be made fat. When The boy is fat, a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches will eat The boy.’ the girl began to weep bitterly, but weep was all in vain, for the girl was forced to do what a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches commanded. And now the best food was cooked for The boy, but the girl got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches crept to a little stable, and cried: ‘The boy, stretch out The boy's finger that a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches may feel if The boy will soon be fat.’ The boy, however, stretched out a little bone to a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, could not see a little bone, and thought a little bone was your finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening The boy. When four weeks had gone by, and The boy still remained thin, a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then, the girl,’ a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches cried to the girl, ‘stir the girl, and bring some water. Let The boy be fat or lean, tomorrow a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches will kill The boy, and cook The boy.’ Ah, how the girl did lament when the girl had to fetch the water, and how the girl's tears did flow down the girl's cheeks! ‘God, do help a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children,’ the girl cried. ‘If the wild beasts in a great forest had but devoured a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children, a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children should at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep the girl's noise to the girl,’ said a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, ‘it won’t help the girl at all.’ Early in the morning, the girl had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. ‘a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children will bake first,’ said a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, ‘a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches pushed the girl out to the oven. ‘Creep in,’ said a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, ‘and see if the oven is properly heated, so that a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children can put the bread in.’ And once the girl was inside, a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches intended to shut the oven and let the girl bake in the oven, and then a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches would eat the girl, too. But the girl saw what a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches had in mind, and said: ‘the girl do not know how the girl am to do it; how do the girl get in?’ ‘the girl,’ said a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches. ‘The door is big enough; just look, a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches can get in a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches!’ and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches crept up and thrust a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's head into the oven. Then the girl gave a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches a push that drove a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches far into the oven, and shut The door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches began to howl quite horribly, but the girl ran away and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches was miserably burnt to death. the girl, however, ran like lightning to The boy, opened The boy's little stable, and cried: ‘The boy, a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children are saved! a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches is dead!’ Then The boy sprang like a bird from a bird's cage when the door is opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, they went into a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's , and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. ‘pearls and jewels are far better than pebbles!’ said The boy, and thrust into The boy's pockets whatever could be got in, and the girl said: ‘the girl, too, will take something home with the girl,’ and filled the girl's pinafore full. ‘But now they must be off,’ said The boy, ‘that they may get out of a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches's .’ When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water. ‘they cannot cross,’ said The boy, ‘The boy see no foot-plank, and no bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered the girl, ‘but a white duck is swimming there: if the girl ask a white duck, a white duck will help a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children over.’ Then the girl cried:  ‘a white duck, a white duck, dost a white duck see, his two children The boy the girl are waiting for a white duck?   There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,   Take a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children across on a white duck's back so white.’ a white duck came to a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children, and The boy seated The boy on thy back so white, and told The boy's to sit by The boy. ‘No,’ replied the girl, ‘that will be too heavy for a white duck; a white duck shall take a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children across, one after the other.’ a white duck did so, and when a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children were once safely across and had walked for a short time, a great forest seemed to be more and more familiar to a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children, and at length a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children saw from afar the house. Then a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children round a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children's neck. a poor wood-cutter had not known one happy hour since a poor wood-cutter had left his two children in a great forest; the girl, however, was dead. the girl emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and The boy threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to pearls and precious stones. Then all anxiety was at an end, and a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever catches a mouse, may make himself a big fur cap out of a mouse.","[[[6, 10], [12, 12], [15, 15], [29, 29], [48, 48], [59, 59], [66, 66], [73, 73], [76,

19,"THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE","Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw to the cooking. When people are too well off they always begin to long for something new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life. Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water. And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited. He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another. So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life. Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned.","Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together.

Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. a bird hastened to fetch some water, but a bird's pail fell into the well, and a bird after his pail, and as a bird was unable to recover a bird, a bird was drowned.","[[[5, 13], [32, 32], [50, 50], [153, 155], [373, 377]], [[8, 9], [53, 55], [106, 107], [121, 121], [128, 128], [138, 138], [266, 267], [274, 274], [315, 316], [330, 330], [386, 387], [427, 428], [447, 448], [492, 493], [500, 500], [509, 509], [536, 537], [551, 551], [627, 628], [702, 703], [715, 715], [723, 723], [728, 728], [770, 771], [779, 779], [787, 787], [793, 793], [798, 798], [800, 800]], [[5, 6], [69, 70], [170, 171], [182, 182], [186, 186], [373, 374], [420, 421], [454, 455], [595, 596], [634, 635], [668, 668], [675, 675], [680, 680], [691, 691]], [[12, 13], [76, 77], [200, 201], [226, 226], [229, 229], [376, 377], [411, 412], [439, 440], [467, 468], [479, 480], [498, 498], [518, 519], [523, 523], [534, 534], [568, 569], [651, 652]], [[84, 84], [89, 89]], [[115, 130], [133, 135]], [[72, 73], [179, 180], [431, 432]], [[240, 241], [249, 249]], [[277, 277], [285, 285], [288, 288], [291, 291], [294, 294], [402, 402], [463, 464], [487, 487], [604, 604]], [[62, 63], [323, 324], [416, 417]], [[327, 328], [333, 333]], [[174, 175], [450, 451]], [[206, 207], [458, 459], [671, 672]], [[512, 534], [525, 525], [540, 541], [559, 560], [563, 563], [576, 576], [582, 582], [598, 598]], [[531, 531], [543, 547]], [[564, 564], [572, 572]], [[638, 639], [645, 645]], [[660, 661], [666, 666]], [[585, 586], [730, 731]], [[779, 780], [789, 789]]]"
20,MOTHER HOLLE,"Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’ The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle. She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming in every direction. She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out. She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all, are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again. The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful, however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service. She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled meats every day. So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.’ Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself.’ Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from head to foot. ‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well. The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old world close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the cock who was perched on the well, called out:  ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!   Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’ Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself. Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty my hands for you?’ and walked on. Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and passed on. At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman. The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her, as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her. ‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut the gate. So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the well called out as she saw her:  ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!   Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’ But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to her as long as she lived.","Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of two daughters was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. a widow who had two daughters, however, loved one of them best, because one of them was a widow who had two daughters's own daughter, and so the other, who was only a widow who had two daughters's stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family. the other, who was only her stepdaughter's sent the other, who was only her stepdaughter out every day to sit by the well in the high road, there to spin until the other, who was only her stepdaughter made the other, who was only her stepdaughter's fingers bleed.

Stay with an old woman; if the other, who was only her stepdaughter will do the work of a little house properly for an old woman, an old woman will make the other, who was only her stepdaughter very happy. the other, who was only her stepdaughter must be very careful, however, to make an old woman's bed in the right way, for an old woman wish the other, who was only her stepdaughter always to shake my bed thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for an old woman am Mother Holle.’ an old woman spoke so kindly, that the other, who was only her stepdaughter summoned up courage and agreed to enter into an old woman's service. the other, who was only her stepdaughter took care to do everything according to an old woman's bidding and every time the other, who was only her stepdaughter made my bed the other, who was only her stepdaughter shook my bed with all the other, who was only her stepdaughter's might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. an old woman was as good as an old woman's word: an old woman never spoke angrily to the other, who was only her stepdaughter, and gave the other, who was only her stepdaughter's roast and boiled meats every day.

After waiting awhile, the other, who was only her stepdaughter went to an old woman and said, ‘the other, who was only her stepdaughter am so homesick, that the other, who was only her stepdaughter cannot stay with an old woman any longer, for although the other, who was only her stepdaughter am so happy here, the other, who was only her stepdaughter must return to the other, who was only her stepdaughter's own people.’ Then an old woman said, ‘an old woman am pleased that the other, who was only her stepdaughter should want to go back to my own people, and as the other, who was only her stepdaughter have served an old woman so well and faithfully, an old woman will take the other, who was only her stepdaughter home an old woman.’ Thereupon an old woman led the other, who was only her stepdaughter by the hand up to a broad gateway. a broad gateway was opened, and as the other, who was only her stepdaughter passed through, a shower of gold fell upon the other, who was only her stepdaughter, and gold clung to the other, who was only her stepdaughter, so that the other, who was only her stepdaughter was covered with gold from head to foot. ‘That is a reward for the other, who was only her stepdaughter's industry,’ said an old woman, and as an old woman spoke an old woman handed the other, who was only her stepdaughter the spindle which an old woman had dropped into the well in the high road. a broad gateway was then closed, and the other, who was only her stepdaughter found the other, who was only her stepdaughter back in the old world close to an old woman's house. As the other, who was only her stepdaughter entered the courtyard, the cock who was perched on the well in the high road, called out:  ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!   an old woman's golden daughter’s come back to an old woman.’ Then the other, who was only her stepdaughter went in to her mother and sister, and as the other, who was only her stepdaughter was so richly covered with gold, her mother and sister gave the other, who was only her stepdaughter a warm welcome. the other, who was only her stepdaughter related to her mother and sister all that had happened, and when a widow who had two daughters heard how a widow who had two daughters had come by a widow who had two daughters's great riches, a widow who had two daughters thought a widow who had two daughters should like the other, who was only her stepdaughter to go and try the other, who was only her stepdaughter's fortune. So a widow who had two daughters made the other, who was only her stepdaughter go and sit by the well in the high road and spin, and the other, who was only her stepdaughter pricked the other, who was only her stepdaughter's finger and thrust the other, who was only her stepdaughter's hand into a thorn-bush, so that the other, who was only her stepdaughter might drop some blood on to the spindle; then the other, who was only her stepdaughter threw some blood into the well in the high road, and jumped in the other, who was only her stepdaughter.

But the other, who was only her stepdaughter answered, ‘Do the loaves as before think the other, who was only her stepdaughter am going to dirty the other, who was only her stepdaughter's hands for the loaves as before?’ and walked on. Presently the other, who was only her stepdaughter came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake the apple-tree, shake the apple-tree, the apple-tree pray; the apple-tree's apples, one and all, are ripe,’ the apple-tree cried. But the other, who was only her stepdaughter only answered, ‘A nice thing to ask the other, who was only her stepdaughter to do, one of my apples might fall on the other, who was only her stepdaughter's head,’ and passed on. At last the other, who was only her stepdaughter came to an old woman's house, and as the other, who was only her stepdaughter had heard all about the large teeth from the other, who was only her stepdaughter, the other, who was only her stepdaughter was not afraid of the large teeth, and engaged the other, who was only her stepdaughter without delay to an old woman.

Your golden daughter’s’s come back to an old woman.’ But, try what the other, who was only her stepdaughter would, the other, who was only her stepdaughter could not get pitch off and pitch stuck to the other, who was only her stepdaughter as long as the other, who was only her stepdaughter lived.","[[[10, 11], [15, 15]], [[6, 11], [27, 28], [43, 43], [55, 55], [78, 79], [157, 158], [970, 971], [974, 974], [978, 978], [982, 982], [984, 984], [987, 987], [1000, 1000]], [[13, 15], [33, 37], [41, 41]], [[49, 56], [78, 78], [81, 81], [99, 99], [101, 101], [121, 122], [138, 138], [146, 146], [153, 153], [157, 157], [162, 162], [167, 167], [177, 177], [186, 186], [189, 189], [196, 197], [213, 213], [215, 215], [224, 224], [229, 229], [233, 233], [252, 252], [260, 260], [277, 277], [308, 308], [320, 320], [328, 328], [365, 365], [377, 377], [382, 382], [397, 397], [414, 414], [424, 424], [438, 438], [454, 454], [459, 459], [463, 464], [471, 471], [486, 486], [490, 490], [510, 510], [554, 555], [567, 567], [583, 583], [587, 587], [592, 592], [621, 621], [625, 625], [634, 634], [646, 646], [652, 652], [659, 659], [664, 664], [677, 677], [679, 679], [684, 684], [696, 696], [705, 705], [714, 714], [720, 720], [731, 731], [737, 737], [741, 741], [756, 756], [763, 763], [769, 769], [781, 781], [789, 790], [807, 808], [818, 818], [825, 825], [829, 829], [845, 845], [859, 859], [877, 878], [880, 880], [888, 888], [894, 894], [933, 933], [937, 937], [944, 944], [954, 954], [959, 959], [987, 991], [996, 996], [1002, 1003], [1014, 1015], [1017, 1017], [1021, 1021], [1031, 1031], [1042, 1042], [1052, 1052], [1055, 1055], [1055, 1056], [1057, 1057], [1069, 1069], [1110, 1112], [1119, 1119], [1124, 1124], [1135, 1135], [1168, 1168], [1178, 1178], [1189, 1189], [1199, 1199], [1209, 1209], [1218, 1218], [1218, 1219], [1221, 1221], [1230, 1230], [1241, 1241], [1250, 1250], [1257, 1257], [1262, 1262], [1274, 1274], [1279, 1279], [1286, 1286], [1293, 1293], [1311, 1311], [1343, 1343], [1347, 1347], [1348, 1348], [1352, 1354], [1363, 1363], [1377, 1377], [1383, 1383], [1383, 1384], [1393, 1393], [1413, 1413], [1421, 1421], [1437, 1439], [1459, 1459], [1486, 1486], [1489, 1489], [1500, 1500], [1504, 1504]], [[88, 93], [125, 126], [143, 144], [184, 185], [201, 202], [867, 868], [905, 906], [1008, 1009], [1046, 1047], [1452, 1453]], [[111, 112], [129, 129]], [[116, 117], [132, 133], [180, 181], [192, 192], [221, 222], [1038, 1039]], [[235, 250], [255, 256], [1060, 1062], [1067, 1067]], [[269, 269], [272, 273], [281, 281], [285, 285], [291, 291], [299, 299], [316, 317]], [[331, 335], [339, 339], [342, 342], [344, 344], [349, 350], [353, 353], [367, 368], [394, 394]], [[335, 335], [353, 358], [371, 372], [400, 401]], [[426, 428], [449, 451], [468, 468], [477, 477], [481, 481], [483, 483], [500, 500], [508, 508], [540, 540], [546, 548], [564, 564], [575, 578], [606, 608], [613, 613], [616, 616], [638, 639], [692, 693], [708, 709], [725, 725], [747, 748], [752, 752], [772, 772], [778, 778], [783, 783], [787, 787], [850, 851], [855, 855], [857, 857], [863, 863], [888, 890], [922, 922], [929, 929], [1202, 1204], [1234, 1236], [1253, 1254], [1315, 1318], [1336, 1337], [1374, 1375], [1380, 1380], [1426, 1428], [1431, 1431], [1457, 1457], [1472, 1472], [1479, 1479]], [[418, 420], [477, 478]], [[500, 501], [514, 514], [585, 586], [589, 589]], [[519, 520], [597, 598]], [[741, 743], [763, 765]], [[796, 798], [800, 801], [870, 871], [1387, 1389], [1433, 1434]], [[815, 815], [821, 822], [833, 833]], [[696, 699], [937, 940], [952, 952], [962, 962]], [[1034, 1035], [1044, 1044]], [[263, 269], [1072, 1073]], [[1077, 1077], [1081, 1081], [1087, 1087], [1095, 1095], [1104, 1105]], [[1104, 1107], [1117, 1117], [1127, 1127]], [[1138, 1141], [1145, 1145], [1148, 1148], [1150, 1150], [1153, 1153], [1164, 1164]], [[1153, 1154], [1184, 1185]], [[1214, 1216], [1226, 1226]], [[1315, 1319], [1326, 1326]], [[1346, 1346], [1358, 1358]], [[1260, 1266], [1366, 1367]], [[1405, 1409], [1416, 1416]], [[899, 906], [1449, 1453]], [[913, 919], [1463, 1469]], [[922, 925], [1472, 1474]], [[1446, 1446], [1493, 1494], [1497, 1497]]]"
21,LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD],"Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’ One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’ ‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him. ‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he. ‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’ ‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’ ‘To my grandmother’s.’ ‘What have you got in your apron?’ ‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.’ ‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’ ‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap. The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.’ Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood. Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked at the door. ‘Who is there?’ ‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.’ ‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot get up.’ The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains. Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her. She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange. ‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’ ‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply. ‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said. ‘The better to see you with, my dear.’ ‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’ ‘The better to hug you with.’ ‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’ ‘The better to eat you with!’ And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap. When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead. Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’","Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, but most of all by a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother's grandmother, and there was nothing that her grandmother would not have given to a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother. Once her grandmother gave a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother a little cap of red velvet, which suited a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother so well that a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother would never wear anything else; so a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’ One day a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother's mother said to a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother: ‘Come, a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take a piece of cake and a bottle of wine to her grandmother, her grandmother is ill and weak, and a piece of cake and a bottle of wine will do her grandmother's good.

The huntsman drew off a wolf's skin and went home with the wolf’s skin; her grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother had brought, and revived, but a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother thought to a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother: ‘As long as a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother live, a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother will never by a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother leave the path, to run into the wood, when her mother has forbidden a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother to do so.’","[[[6, 26], [18, 18], [25, 25], [39, 40], [45, 45], [55, 55], [59, 59], [67, 67], [80, 80], [84, 84], [89, 92], [109, 109], [134, 134], [151, 151], [161, 161], [169, 169], [194, 194], [200, 200], [208, 211], [213, 213], [218, 218], [241, 244], [252, 252], [254, 256], [280, 283], [303, 306], [311, 311], [319, 319], [322, 322], [356, 356], [360, 363], [406, 409], [430, 430], [464, 467], [477, 480], [492, 492], [503, 503], [515, 515], [521, 521], [539, 542], [544, 544], [549, 549], [567, 567], [572, 572], [593, 593], [605, 605], [620, 620], [625, 625], [628, 628], [675, 678], [686, 686], [772, 775], [788, 788], [794, 794], [800, 800], [802, 802], [814, 814], [828, 828], [834, 834], [841, 841], [844, 844], [852, 852], [860, 860], [869, 869], [884, 884], [897, 897], [919, 919], [935, 935], [938, 939], [958, 958], [966, 966], [990, 990], [1039, 1041], [1213, 1217], [1229, 1231], [1242, 1242], [1272, 1274], [1284, 1284], [1348, 1350], [1358, 1360], [1363, 1363], [1369, 1369], [1372, 1372], [1376, 1376], [1388, 1388], [1392, 1392]], [[25, 26], [33, 33], [43, 43], [109, 110], [112, 112], [122, 122], [161, 162], [172, 172], [223, 224], [311, 313], [338, 340], [349, 349], [356, 357], [379, 379], [437, 439], [574, 574], [582, 582], [658, 660], [706, 707], [710, 710], [742, 744], [749, 749], [755, 755], [761, 761], [802, 803], [812, 812], [864, 864], [897, 898], [900, 900], [905, 905], [916, 916], [926, 926], [938, 938], [949, 949], [954, 954], [969, 969], [976, 976], [981, 981], [999, 999], [1006, 1006], [1015, 1015], [1083, 1085], [1094, 1094], [1168, 1169], [1173, 1173], [1258, 1260], [1338, 1339]], [[96, 104], [107, 107], [119, 119]], [[101, 104], [156, 157]], [[179, 179], [196, 196]], [[80, 81], [213, 214], [1388, 1389]], [[46, 64], [221, 221]], [[228, 229], [246, 247], [376, 377], [533, 534], [611, 612], [649, 650], [1384, 1385]], [[249, 250], [264, 264], [274, 274], [287, 287], [291, 291], [294, 294], [398, 398], [411, 412], [415, 415], [441, 441], [454, 454], [471, 471], [497, 497], [653, 654], [682, 683], [722, 723], [738, 738], [752, 752], [759, 759], [764, 764], [1022, 1023], [1031, 1031], [1044, 1045], [1048, 1048], [1051, 1051], [1117, 1118], [1128, 1128], [1131, 1133], [1144, 1144], [1156, 1156], [1163, 1164], [1200, 1202], [1251, 1252], [1286, 1288], [1293, 1293], [1296, 1296], [1309, 1309], [1328, 1330]], [[379, 380], [402, 402]], [[575, 577], [579, 579]], [[147, 148], [608, 609], [1378, 1379]], [[630, 635], [640, 640]], [[665, 666], [694, 695], [728, 729]], [[700, 701], [725, 726]], [[742, 745], [887, 888], [1056, 1057], [1111, 1112], [1122, 1122]], [[769, 770], [892, 893]], [[761, 762], [900, 901]], [[658, 661], [1073, 1074]], [[1068, 1069], [1079, 1079], [1089, 1089], [1100, 1100], [1108, 1108], [1114, 1114], [1126, 1126], [1137, 1137], [1140, 1140], [1150, 1150], [1161, 1161], [1180, 1180], [1205, 1205], [1211, 1211], [1222, 1222], [1324, 1325]], [[831, 832], [1103, 1104]], [[1197, 1202], [1286, 1289]], [[1280, 1289], [1303, 1304]], [[1328, 1331], [1336, 1336]]]"
22,It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old," grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door, that he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: ‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.

23,THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM,"There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband. She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I will strew ashes along the path.’ When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest, darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’ The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage on the wall. Again it cried:  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’ The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband lives here?’ ‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.’ Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak, or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape.’ The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned, dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it. The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers, and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’ ‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down. The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs, opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’ den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father all that had happened. The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast, each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did not say a word. ‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no tale you know? Tell us something.’ ‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:  ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,   Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’ and again a second time it said these words.’ ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’ ‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty, and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered, “Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards cook and eat you.”’ ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’ ‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow, and with that she died.’ ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’ ‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’ ‘My darling, this is only a dream.’ ‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the assembled guests. The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were condemned to death for their wicked deeds.","There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as one beautiful daughter was grown up, a miller who had one beautiful daughter was anxious that one beautiful daughter should be well married and provided for. a miller who had one beautiful daughter said to a miller who had one beautiful daughter, ‘a miller who had one beautiful daughter will give one beautiful daughter to the first suitable man who comes and asks for one beautiful daughter's hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as a suitor appeared to be very rich and a miller who had one beautiful daughter could see nothing in a suitor with which to find fault, a miller who had one beautiful daughter betrothed a miller who had one beautiful daughter's to a suitor.

One day a suitor said to one beautiful daughter, ‘one beautiful daughter have not yet paid a suitor a visit, although we have been betrothed for some time.’ ‘one beautiful daughter do not know where a suitor's house is,’ one beautiful daughter answered. ‘your house is out there in the dark forest,’ a suitor said. one beautiful daughter tried to excuse one beautiful daughter by saying that one beautiful daughter would not be able to find the way thither. a suitor only replied, ‘one beautiful daughter must come and see a suitor next Sunday; a suitor have already invited guests for next Sunday, and that one beautiful daughter may not mistake the way, a suitor will strew ashes along the way.’ When next Sunday came, and it was time for one beautiful daughter to start, a feeling of dread came over one beautiful daughter which one beautiful daughter could not explain, and that one beautiful daughter might be able to find the way again, one beautiful daughter filled one beautiful daughter's pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as one beautiful daughter went along.

At last one beautiful daughter went down to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep one beautiful daughter's head still. one beautiful daughter asked one beautiful daughter if my betrothed husband lived here, and one beautiful daughter answered, “Ah, one beautiful daughter, one beautiful daughter are come to a murderers’ den; my betrothed husband does indeed live here, but my betrothed husband will kill one beautiful daughter without mercy and afterwards cook and eat one beautiful daughter.”’ ‘The bridegroom's , this is only a dream.’ ‘a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from shaking hid one beautiful daughter behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view, and scarcely had a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from shaking done hid when they returned home, dragging a young girl along with they. they gave a young girl three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow, and with three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow a young girl died.’ ‘one beautiful daughter, this is only a dream.’ ‘Then they tore off a young girl's dainty clothing, and cut a young girl's beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon her beautiful body.’ ‘one beautiful daughter, this is only a dream.’ ‘And one of they saw that there was a gold ring still left on a young girl's finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, one of the robbers took a hatchet and cut off her finger; but her finger sprang into the air and fell behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view into one beautiful daughter's lap. And here is her fingera gold ring.’ And with these words a young girl drew forth her finger and shewed her finger to a large company of guests. The bridegroom, up and tried to escape, but a large company of guests seized The bridegroom and held The bridegroom fast. a large company of guests delivered The bridegroom up to justice, and The bridegroom and all The bridegroom's murderous band were condemned to death for he and all his murderous band's wicked deeds.","[[[7, 9], [13, 13], [22, 22], [40, 40], [51, 51], [86, 87], [92, 93], [111, 111], [116, 116], [122, 122], [142, 142], [145, 145], [165, 165], [175, 175], [193, 193], [197, 197], [201, 201], [212, 212], [218, 218], [238, 238], [263, 264], [274, 274], [276, 276], [283, 283], [289, 289], [293, 293], [295, 295], [307, 307], [318, 318], [328, 328], [339, 339], [343, 343], [346, 346], [352, 352], [365, 365], [382, 382], [386, 386], [419, 421], [433, 434], [466, 468], [480, 481], [502, 502], [509, 509], [538, 538], [542, 543], [547, 547], [557, 559], [572, 572], [584, 584], [586, 586], [593, 593], [606, 606], [609, 609], [616, 616], [638, 638], [645, 645], [653, 653], [669, 669], [672, 672], [674, 674], [685, 685], [694, 694], [724, 724], [853, 856], [866, 866], [876, 876], [937, 942], [964, 964], [989, 989], [1065, 1066], [1072, 1072], [1079, 1079], [1100, 1100], [1107, 1107], [1115, 1115], [1119, 1119], [1127, 1127], [1203, 1204], [1206, 1206], [1267, 1268], [1280, 1280], [1282, 1283], [1292, 1292], [1299, 1299], [1308, 1308], [1319, 1320], [1323, 1323], [1341, 1341], [1367, 1369], [1393, 1394], [1404, 1404], [1431, 1431], [1452, 1452], [1456, 1456], [1458, 1458], [1460, 1460], [1466, 1466], [1472, 1474], [1476, 1476], [1485, 1485], [1496, 1496], [1504, 1504], [1509, 1510], [1524, 1524], [1575, 1575], [1575, 1576], [1609, 1609], [1609, 1610], [1671, 1671]], [[3, 9], [18, 18], [31, 31], [34, 34], [37, 37], [71, 72], [84, 84], [86, 86], [1206, 1207], [1236, 1237], [1244, 1244]], [[58, 59], [64, 64], [77, 77], [89, 89], [98, 99], [119, 119], [127, 127], [131, 131], [139, 139], [150, 150], [170, 170], [179, 179], [190, 190], [212, 213], [223, 223], [227, 227], [245, 245]], [[101, 102], [107, 107]], [[170, 171], [179, 180]], [[224, 225], [233, 234], [255, 255]], [[242, 243], [250, 251], [289, 290], [1183, 1184]], [[185, 187], [316, 317], [361, 362]], [[324, 324], [327, 327]], [[367, 384], [378, 378]], [[407, 408], [440, 441]], [[444, 452], [455, 455]], [[427, 430], [474, 477], [1375, 1378]], [[518, 532], [529, 529], [536, 536], [563, 565], [624, 624], [663, 663], [681, 683], [707, 707], [740, 740], [758, 758], [979, 981], [1009, 1011], [1031, 1033], [1129, 1131], [1520, 1522], [1533, 1533]], [[512, 513], [577, 577], [1054, 1055], [1435, 1436]], [[636, 636], [640, 640], [642, 642], [656, 656], [729, 730], [761, 763], [772, 772], [774, 774], [789, 789], [826, 826], [878, 879], [883, 883], [1017, 1018], [1021, 1021], [1040, 1040], [1046, 1046], [1537, 1538], [1548, 1548], [1550, 1550], [1587, 1587], [1623, 1624]], [[155, 155], [735, 735]], [[767, 769], [784, 784], [791, 791], [817, 817], [822, 822], [829, 829], [834, 834], [841, 841], [896, 898]], [[841, 843], [851, 851]], [[687, 696], [862, 863], [931, 932], [967, 969], [1076, 1077], [1526, 1528], [1667, 1669]], [[881, 883], [902, 902], [910, 910], [944, 945], [956, 956]], [[886, 898], [906, 906], [953, 953], [960, 960], [994, 995]], [[892, 898], [917, 918], [921, 922], [1000, 1001], [1025, 1026]], [[1088, 1095], [1110, 1110]], [[1085, 1095], [1123, 1123]], [[1127, 1131], [1144, 1144], [1152, 1152], [1178, 1178], [1189, 1189], [1197, 1197]], [[579, 582], [1147, 1150], [1480, 1483]], [[1224, 1225], [1282, 1282], [1287, 1288], [1311, 1311], [1393, 1393], [1509, 1509], [1702, 1712], [1724, 1724], [1727, 1727], [1732, 1732], [1738, 1738], [1741, 1741]], [[1250, 1250], [1303, 1303]], [[451, 452], [1355, 1356]], [[1346, 1356], [1386, 1386]], [[1334, 1335], [1408, 1409]], [[547, 549], [1460, 1461], [1485, 1486], [1493, 1493]], [[1523, 1523], [1535, 1535]], [[1543, 1545], [1552, 1552], [1570, 1570], [1590, 1590], [1596, 1596], [1635, 1635], [1654, 1654], [1688, 1689]], [[1553, 1565], [1569, 1569]], [[1596, 1598], [1605, 1605]], [[1621, 1624], [1647, 1647]], [[1635, 1636], [1654, 1655], [1658, 1659], [1677, 1681], [1692, 1693], [1696, 1696]], [[1629, 1631], [1680, 1681]], [[1229, 1233], [1698, 1700], [1721, 1722], [1730, 1730]], [[1738, 1743], [1749, 1749]]]"
24,TOM THUMB,"A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is, wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’ ‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas Thumb. They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born. Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about. One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that; the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’ When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer, indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please. The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me; I’ll soon come back to you.’ So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his father they took him away with them. They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as sulky as could be. When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’ At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept. Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’ They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said they. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him up in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house, and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’ When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl, ‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened, and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’ But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, ‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’ The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open. The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.’ Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring me any more hay!’ The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the cow-house, to try and see what was the matter. Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill. Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away. Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’ said the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own father’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can wish.’ The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that he could not go out by the same way he came in. This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a great shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’ ‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as loud as he could. The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman, ‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here, the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father, ‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’ ‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’ ‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world.’ Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey. So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!","A poor woodman sat in A poor woodman's cottage one night, smoking A poor woodman's pipe by the fireside, while A poor woodman's wife sat by A poor woodman's side spinning. ‘How lonely it is, his wife,’ said A poor woodman, as A poor woodman puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and A poor woodman to sit here by you and me, without any children to play about and amuse you and me while other people seem so happy and merry with other people's children!’ ‘What A poor woodman say is very true,’ said his wife, sighing, and turning round his wife's wheel; ‘how happy should his wife be if his wife had but one child! If but one child were ever so small--nay, if but one child were no bigger than his wife's thumb--his wife should be very happy, and love but one child dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to pass that his wife wish was fulfilled, just in the very way his wife had wished it; for, not long afterwards, his wife had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, ‘Well, they cannot say they have not got what they wished for, and, little as a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb is, they will love a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb dearly.’ And they called a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb Thomas Thumb. they gave a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb plenty of food, yet for all they could do a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb never grew bigger, but kept just the same size as a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb had been when a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb was born. Still, a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb's eyes were sharp and sparkling, and a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb soon showed a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb was about. One day, as A poor woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, A poor woodman said, ‘A poor woodman wish A poor woodman had someone to bring the cart after A poor woodman, for A poor woodman want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, A poor woodman,’ cried my, ‘my will take care of that; the cart shall be in the wood by the time A poor woodman want the cart.’ Then A poor woodman laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? my cannot reach up to the horse’s bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, A poor woodman,’ said my; ‘if my's will only harness the horse’s, my will get into the horse’s's ear and tell the horse’s which way to go.’ ‘Well,’ said A poor woodman, ‘we will try for once.’ When the time came his wife harnessed the horse’s to the cart, and put my into his ear; and as my sat there my told the horse’s how to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as my wanted: and thus the horse’s went on just as well as if A poor woodman had driven the horse’s A poor woodman into the wood. It happened that as the horse’s was going a little too fast, and my was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and one hear a carter talking to the horse’s, but yet one can see no one.’ ‘That is queer, indeed,’ said the other; ‘let two strangers follow the cart, and see where the cart goes.’ So two strangers went on into the wood, till at last two strangers came to the place where A poor woodman was. Then my, seeing my's , cried out, ‘See, A poor woodman, here my am with the cart, all right and safe! now take my down!’ So my's took hold of the horse’s with one hand, and with the other took my out of his ear, and put my down upon a straw, where my sat as merry as you please. two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘my will make two strangers's fortune, if two strangers can get my, and carry my about from town to town as a show; two strangers must buy my.’ So two strangers went up to A poor woodman, and asked A poor woodman what A poor woodman would take for my. ‘my will be better off,’ said two strangers, ‘with two strangers than with A poor woodman.’ ‘A poor woodman won’t sell my at all,’ said A poor woodman; ‘A poor woodman's own flesh and blood is dearer to A poor woodman than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But my, hearing of the bargain two strangers wanted to make, crept up my's coat to A poor woodman's shoulder and whispered in A poor woodman's ear, ‘Take the money, A poor woodman, and let two strangers have my; my’ll soon come back to A poor woodman.’ So A poor woodman at last said A poor woodman would sell my to two strangers for a large piece of gold, and two strangers paid a large piece of gold. ‘Where would A poor woodman like to sit?’ said onetwo strangers. ‘Oh, put A poor woodman on the rim of A poor woodman's hat; that will be a nice gallery for A poor woodman; A poor woodman can walk about there and see the country as we go along.’ So two strangers did as A poor woodman wished; and when my had taken leave of my's two strangers took my away with two strangers. we journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then my said, ‘Let my get down, my’m tired.’ So one took off your hat, and put my down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the road. But my ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, two strangers!’ said my, ‘my’m off! mind and look sharp after my the next time.’ Then two strangers ran at once to an old mouse-hole, and poked the ends of two strangers's sticks into an old mouse-hole, but all in vain; my only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark, so that two strangers were forced to go two strangers's way without two strangers's prize, as sulky as could be. When my found two strangers were gone, my came out of an old mouse-hole. ‘What dangerous walking it is,’ said my, ‘in a ploughed field by the side of the road! If my were to fall from one of these great clods, my should undoubtedly break my's neck.’ At last, by good luck, my found a large empty snail-shell. ‘a large empty snail-shell is lucky,’ said my, ‘my can sleep here very well’; and in my crept. Just as my was falling asleep, my heard two men passing by, chatting together; and one said to the other, ‘How can two men rob that rich parson’s house of that rich parson’s's silver and gold?’ ‘my’ll tell two men!’ cried my. ‘What noise was that?’ said one, frightened; ‘one’m sure one heard someone speak.’ two men stood still listening, and my said, ‘Take my with two men, and my’ll soon show two men how to get his silver and gold.’ ‘But where are my?’ said two men. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered my, ‘and listen where the sound comes from.’ At last two men found my out, and lifted my up in two men's hands. ‘my!’ two men said, ‘what can my do for two men?’ ‘Why, my can get between the iron window-bars of that rich parson’s house, and throw my out whatever my want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said two men; ‘come along, two men shall see what two men can do.’ When two men came to that rich parson’s house, my slipped through the iron window-bars of the parson’s house into the room, and then called out as loud as my could bawl, ‘Will two men have all that is here?’ At this two men were frightened, and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that my may not awaken anybody.’ But my seemed as if my did not understand two men, and bawled out again, ‘How much will two men have? Shall my throw all that is here out?’ Now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise the cook raised the cook up in the cook's bed and listened. Meantime two men were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at last two men plucked up two men's hearts, and said, ‘my is only trying to make fools of two men.’ So two men came back and whispered softly to my, saying, ‘Now let two men have no more of my's roguish jokes; but throw two men out some of his silver and gold.’ Then my called out as loud as my could, ‘Very well! hold two men's hands! here his silver and gold comes.’ the cook heard called quite plain, so the cook sprang out of bed, and ran to open the door. two men ran off as if a wolf was at two men's tails: and the cook, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the time the cook came back, my had slipped off into the barn; and when the cook had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, the cook went to bed, thinking the cook must have been dreaming with the cook's eyes open. my crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug place to finish my's night’s rest in; so my laid my down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find my's way home to my's father and mother. But alas! how woefully my was undone! what crosses and sorrows happen to us all in this world! the cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of hay, with my in the middle of a large bundle of hay, fast asleep. my still, however, slept on, and did not awake till my found my in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put a large bundle of hay into the cow rick, and the cow had taken my up in a mouthful of a large bundle of hay. ‘Good lack-a-day!’ said my, ‘how came my to tumble into the mill?’ But my soon found out where my really was; and was forced to have all my's wits about my, that my might not get between the cow's teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last down my went into the cow's stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said my; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.’ Though my made the best of my's bad luck, my did not like my's quarters at all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming down, and the space left for my became smaller and smaller. At last my cried out as loud as my could, ‘Don’t bring my any more hay! Don’t bring my any more hay!’ the cook happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that the cook had heard in the night, the cook was so frightened that the cook fell off the cook's stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as the cook could pick the cook up out of the dirt, the cook ran off as fast as the cook could to the cook's , and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But that rich parson’s said, ‘the cook, the cook art surely mad!’ However, that rich parson’s went with the cook into that rich parson’s house, to try and see what was the matter. Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when my called out, ‘Don’t bring my any more hay!’ Then that rich parson’s was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told that rich parson’s's man to kill the cow on the spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and her stomach, was thrown out upon a dunghill. my soon set my to work to get out, which was not a very easy task; but at last, just as my had made room to get my's head out, fresh ill-luck befell my. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up her stomach, with Tom in her stomach, at one gulp, and ran away. my, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking A hungry wolf would not dislike having some chat with my as my was going along, my called out, ‘A hungry wolf, my can show A hungry wolf a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s a famous treat?’ said A hungry wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said my, describing that rich parson’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and then into the pantry, and there A hungry wolf will find cakes, ham, beef, cold chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that A hungry wolf's heart can wish.’ A hungry wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night A hungry wolf went to that rich parson’s house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the pantry, and ate and drank there to A hungry wolf's heart’s content. As soon as A hungry wolf had had enough A hungry wolf wanted to get away; but A hungry wolf had eaten so much that A hungry wolf could not go out by the same way A hungry wolf came in. This was just what my had reckoned upon; and now my began to set up a great shout, making all the noise my could. ‘Will my be easy?’ said A hungry wolf; ‘my’ll awaken everybody in that rich parson’s house if my make such a clatter.’ ‘What’s that to my?’ said my; ‘A poor woodman have had A poor woodman's frolic, now my’ve a mind to be merry my’; and my began, singing and shouting as loud as my could. A poor woodman and A poor woodman's wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when The woodman and his wife saw A hungry wolf was there, you may well suppose that The woodman and his wife were sadly frightened; and A poor woodman ran for A poor woodman's axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do his wife stay behind,’ said A poor woodman, ‘and when A poor woodman have knocked my on the head his wife must rip my up with a scythe.’ my heard all this, and cried out, ‘A poor woodman! my am here, A hungry wolf has swallowed my.’ And my's said, ‘Heaven be praised! The woodman and his wife have found The woodman and his wife's again’; and A poor woodman told his wife not to use a scythe for fear his wife should hurt A poor woodman. Then A poor woodman aimed a great blow, and struck my on the head, and killed my on the spot! and when my was dead two men cut open my's body, and set my free. ‘Ah!’ said A poor woodman, ‘what fears The woodman and his wife have had for my!’ ‘Yes, A poor woodman,’ answered my; ‘my have travelled all over the world, my think, in one way or other, since you and me parted; and now my am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’ ‘Why, where have my been?’ said my's . ‘my have been in a mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in A hungry wolf's belly; and yet here my am again, safe and sound.’ ‘Well,’ said The woodman and his wife, ‘my are come back, and The woodman and his wife will not sell my again for all the riches in the world.’ Then The woodman and his wife hugged and kissed The woodman and his wife's , and gave my plenty to eat and drink, for my was very hungry; and then The woodman and his wife fetched new clothes for my, for my's old ones had been quite spoiled on my's journey. So my stayed at home with The woodman and his wife, in peace; for though my had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, my always agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!","[[[0, 2], [5, 5], [11, 11], [18, 18], [22, 22], [36, 36], [39, 39], [52, 52], [83, 83], [313, 314], [327, 327], [331, 331], [333, 333],

25,RUMPELSTILTSKIN,"By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter. She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father, for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door was locked, and she was left alone. She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:  ‘Round about, round about,     Lo and behold!   Reel away, reel away,     Straw into gold!’ And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and the straw was all spun into gold. When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do, and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’ said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang:  ‘Round about, round about,     Lo and behold!   Reel away, reel away,     Straw into gold!’ till, long before morning, all was done again. The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is, you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’ ‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s daughter, and she really became queen. At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’ grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your child.’ Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’ The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of, BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’ The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing:  “Merrily the feast I’ll make.   Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;   Merrily I’ll dance and sing,   For next day will a stranger bring.   Little does my lady dream   Rumpelstiltskin is my name!” When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be ?’ said the lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it out. Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’","By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream of water; and upon a fine stream of water there stood a mill.

26,CLEVER GRETEL,"There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what the food is like.’ It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’ and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught. Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’ She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought: ‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’ So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’ So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: ‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first. While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door. Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: ‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him.","There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels walked out with shoes with red heels on, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels turned a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels this way and that, was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels came home a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels drank, in a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels's gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels tasted the best of whatever a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels was cooking until a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what the food is like.’ It came to pass that the master one day said to a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels: ‘a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare the master two fowls very daintily.’ ‘a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels will see to prepare, the master,’ answered a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels. a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels killed two fowls, scalded two fowls, plucked two fowls, put two fowls on the spit, and towards evening set two fowls before the fire, that two fowls might roast. two fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but a guest coming this evening had not yet arrived. Then a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels called out to the master: ‘If a guest coming this evening does not come, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels must take two fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if two fowls are not eaten the moment two fowls are at two fowls's juiciest.’ the master said: ‘the master will run the master, and fetch a guest coming this evening.’ When the master had turned the master's back, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels laid the spit with two fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when a guest coming this evening will come? Meanwhile, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels will run into the cellar, and take a drink.’ a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless a jug for a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels,’ and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught. Then a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels went and put two fowls down again to the fire, basted two fowls, and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels thought: ‘Something might be wrong, the roast meat ought to be tasted!’ a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels touched the roast meat with a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels's finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that fowls are not eaten at the right time!’ a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with a guest coming this evening, but a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels saw no one, and went back to two fowls and thought: ‘One of the wings is burning! a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels had better take One of the wings off and eat One of the wings.’ So a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels cut One of the wings off, ate One of the wings, and enjoyed One of the wings, and when a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels had done, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else the master will observe that something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels went and looked for the master, and did not see the master.

Just listen how the master is sharpening the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens for the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens!’ a guest coming this evening heard sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as the master could. a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels was not idle; a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels ran screaming to the master, and cried: ‘the master have invited a guest coming this evening!’ ‘Why, a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels? What do a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels mean by that?’ ‘Yes,’ said a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, ‘a guest coming this evening has taken two fowls, off the dish, and has run away with two fowls!’ ‘That’s a nice trick!’ said the master, and lamented two fowls. ‘If a guest coming this evening had but left the master one, so that something remained for the master to eat.’ the master called to a guest coming this evening to stop, but a guest coming this evening pretended not to hear.

His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of which he had to eat. They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’ answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’ The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything.","There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled's ears dull of hearing, a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled's knees trembled, and when a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled sat at table a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let the broth run out of a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled's mouth. a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled's son and His son's wife were disgusted at this, so a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and His son and his son’s wife gave a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled's food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of his food.

28,THE LITTLE PEASANT,"There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her: ‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating. Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away. And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine. Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes. And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers. At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all these skins?’ Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about? What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’ The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water. After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he, ‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.","There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant's wife did so wish to have one. One day just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said to his wife: ‘Listen, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant have a good idea, there is he and his wife's gossip the carpenter, the carpenter shall make he and his wife a wooden calf, and paint a wooden calf brown, so that a wooden calf looks like any other, and in time a wooden calf will certainly get big and be a cow.’ his wife also liked the idea, and he and his wife's gossip the carpenter cut and planed a wooden calf, and painted a wooden calf as a wooden calf ought to be, and made a wooden calf with a wooden calf's head hanging down as if a wooden calf were eating. Next morning when the cows were being driven out, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant have a wooden calf there, but a wooden calf is still small and has to be carried.’ the cow-herd said: ‘All right,’ and took a wooden calf in just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant's arms and carried a wooden calf to the pasture, and set a wooden calf among the grass. a wooden calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘a wooden calf will soon run by a wooden calf, just look how a wooden calf eats already!’ At night when just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant was going to drive the cow-herd home again, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said to a wooden calf: ‘If a wooden calf can stand there and eat a wooden calf's fill, a wooden calf can also go on a wooden calf's four legs; just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant don’t care to drag a wooden calf home again in his arms.’ But just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant stood at just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant's door, and waited for a wooden calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and a wooden calf was missing, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant inquired where a wooden calf was. the cow-herd answered: ‘a wooden calf is still standing out there eating. a wooden calf would not stop and come with the cow-herd.’ But just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant must have a wooden calf back again.’ Then the cow-herd went back to the pasture together, but someone had stolen a wooden calf, and a wooden calf was gone. the cow-herd said: ‘a wooden calf must have run away.’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant run,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away's carelessness condemned just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant to give just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant a cow for a wooden calf. And now he and his wife had a wooden calf, and he and his wife were heartily glad, but he and his wife had no food for a wooden calf, and could give a wooden calf nothing to eat, so a wooden calf soon had to be killed. he and his wife salted the flesh, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant took a raven with broken wings and wrapped a raven with broken wings in the skin. But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant could go no farther, and turned back to a mill and begged for shelter. his wife was alone in the house, and said to just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant: ‘Lay just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant on the straw there,’ and gave just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant a slice of bread and cheese. just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant ate a slice of bread and cheese, and lay down with the skin beside just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, and his wife thought: ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the parson; The miller’s's received the parson well, and said: ‘The miller’s's is out, so we will have a feast.’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant listened, and when just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant heard them talk about feasting just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant was vexed that just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then his wife served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine. Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. his wife said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is his wife's !’ his wife quickly hid roast meat inside the tiled stove, wine under the pillow, salad on the bed, the cakes under the bed, and the parson in the closet on the porch. Then his wife opened the door for his wife's , and said: ‘Thank heaven, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.’ The miller’s saw just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant lying on the straw there, and asked, ‘What is just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said his wife, ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so his wife gave just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant a bit of bread and cheese, and showed just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant where the straw there was.’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said: ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant have no objection, but be quick and get just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant something to eat.’ his wife said: ‘But his wife have nothing but bread and cheese.’ ‘The miller’s am contented with anything,’ replied The miller’s, ‘so far as The miller’s am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant and said: ‘Come and eat some more with The miller’s.’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this The miller’s saw the skin in which a raven with broken wings was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant there?’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant answered: ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant have a soothsayer inside the skin.’ ‘Can a soothsayer foretell anything to The miller’s?’ said The miller’s. ‘Why not?’ answered just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant: ‘but a soothsayer only says four things, and the fifth a soothsayer keeps to a soothsayer.’ The miller’s was curious, and said: ‘Let a soothsayer foretell something for once.’ Then just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant pinched a raven with broken wings's head, so that a raven with broken wings croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller’s said: ‘What did a soothsayer say?’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant answered: ‘In the first place, a soothsayer says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless The miller’s!’ cried The miller’s, and went there and found some wine hidden under the pillow. ‘Now go on,’ said The miller’s. just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant made a raven with broken wings croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, a soothsayer says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon The miller’s's word!’ cried The miller’s, and went thither, and found some roast meat in the tiled stove. just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant made a raven with broken wings prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, a soothsayer says that there is some salad on the bed.’ ‘some salad would be a fine thing!’ cried The miller’s, and went there and found some salad. At last just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant pinched a raven with broken wings once more till a raven with broken wings croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, a soothsayer says that there are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘some cakes would be a fine thing!’ cried The miller’s, and looked there, and found some cakes. And now the cow-herd sat down to the table together, but The miller’s's was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with his wife. The miller’s would have liked much to know the fifth, but just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said: ‘First, the cow-herd will quickly eat four things, for the fifth is something bad.’ So the cow-herd ate, and after that the cow-herd bargained how much The miller’s was to give for the fifth, until the cow-herd agreed on three hundred talers. Then just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant once more pinched the raven’s head till a raven with broken wings croaked loudly. The miller’s asked: ‘What did a raven with broken wings say?’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant replied: ‘a raven with broken wings says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch.’ The miller’s said: ‘the Devil must go out,’ and opened the house-door; then his wife was forced to give up the keys, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant unlocked the closet on the porch. the parson ran out as fast as the parson could, and The miller’s said: ‘It was true; The miller’s saw the Devil with The miller’s's own eyes.’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with three hundred talers. At home just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant gradually launched out; just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant built a beautiful house, and the peasants said: ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.’ Then just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant's wealth came. just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant answered: ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant sold just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant's cow’s skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard sold, the peasants wished to enjoy three hundred talers, and ran home, killed all the peasants's cows, and stripped off the peasants's skins in order to sell their skins in the town to the greatest advantage. the mayor, however, said: ‘But the mayor's must go first.’ When his wife came to the merchant in the town, the merchant in the town did not give his wife more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, the merchant in the town did not give the others so much, and said: ‘What can the merchant in the town do with their skins?’ Then the peasants were vexed that just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant should have thus outwitted the peasants, wanted to take vengeance on just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, and accused just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant of this treachery before the mayor. just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant's soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant looked at a priest, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant recognized the man who had been with The miller’s's . just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said to the man who had been with the miller’s wife: ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant set the man who had been with the miller’s wife free from the closet on the porch, set just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant free from a barrel pierced full of holes.’ At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor, so just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant cried with all just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant's might: ‘No, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant will not do it!’ the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor hearing that, came up to just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, and asked: ‘What are just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant about? What is it that just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant will not do?’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said: ‘They want to make just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant mayor, if just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant will but put just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant in a barrel pierced full of holes, but just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant will not do put.’ the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor would get into a barrel pierced full of holes at once.’ just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant said: ‘If the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor will get in, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor will be mayor.’ the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor was willing, and got in, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant shut the top down on the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor; then just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant took a flock of sheep for just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, and drove a flock of sheep away. the parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. Then the crowd came and rolled a barrel pierced full of holes towards the water. When a barrel pierced full of holes began to roll, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor cried: ‘the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor am quite willing to be mayor.’ the crowd believed no otherwise than that it was just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is what the crowd intend, but first the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor shall look about the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor a little down below there,’ and the crowd rolled a barrel pierced full of holes down into the water. After that the peasants went home, and as the peasants were entering the village, just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said: ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, from whence do just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant come? Have just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant come out of the water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, ‘just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant sank deep, deep down, until at last just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant got to the bottom; just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant pushed the bottom out of a barrel pierced full of holes, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant brought a flock of sheep away with just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, ‘more than just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant could want.’ Then the peasants made up the peasants's minds that the peasants would fetch some sheep for the peasants, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: ‘the mayor come first.’ So the cow-herd went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: ‘the peasants already see the sheep down below!’ the mayor pressed forward and said: ‘the mayor will go down first, and look about the mayor, and if things promise well the mayor’ll call the peasants.’ So the mayor jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if the mayor were calling the peasants, and the crowd plunged in after the mayor as one man. Then the village was dead, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.","[[[15, 25], [27, 27], [47, 47], [49, 49], [60, 60], [68, 68], [167, 169],

29,FREDERICK AND CATHERINE,"There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said. ‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’ ‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak; that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it. Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself. Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah! well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’ At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he, ‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’ The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. ‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.’ Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, ‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’ ‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’ Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them. At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’ said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure you never told me not.’ They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’ said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’ Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way, ‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for I have often seen him take some.’ When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’ ‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’ Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’ Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me, it is hailing.’ A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’ At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound.","There was once a man called Frederick: a man called Frederick had a wife whose name was Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day a man called Frederick said. ‘Kate! a man called Frederick am going to work in the fields; when a man called Frederick come back a man called Frederick shall be hungry so let a man called Frederick have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’ ‘Very well,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew nigh, a wife whose name was Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat a wife whose name was Catherine had, and put a nice steak, which was all the meat she had on the fire to fry. a nice steak, which was all the meat she had soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and a wife whose name was Catherine stood by with a fork and turned a nice steak, which was all the meat she had: then a wife whose name was Catherine said to a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘a nice steak, which was all the meat she had is almost ready, a wife whose name was Catherine may as well go to the cellar for ale.’ So a wife whose name was Catherine left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. ale ran into a large jug and a wife whose name was Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into a wife whose name was Catherine's head, ‘The dog is not shut up--The dog may be running away with a nice steak, which was all the meat she had; running’s well thought of.’ So up a wife whose name was Catherine ran from the cellar; and sure enough The dog had got a nice steak, which was all the meat she had in The dog's mouth, and was making off with a nice steak, which was all the meat she had. Away ran a wife whose name was Catherine, and away ran The dog across the field: but The dog ran faster than a wife whose name was Catherine, and stuck close to a nice steak, which was all the meat she had. ‘a nice steak, which was all the meat she had’s all gone, and “what can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine. So a wife whose name was Catherine turned round; and as a wife whose name was Catherine had run a good way and was tired, a wife whose name was Catherine walked home leisurely to cool a wife whose name was Catherine. Now all this time ale was running too, for a wife whose name was Catherine had not turned the cock; and when a large jug was full ale ran upon the floor till the ale cask was empty. When a wife whose name was Catherine got to the cellar stairs a wife whose name was Catherine saw what had happened. ‘My stars!’ said a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘what shall a wife whose name was Catherine do to keep a man called Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?’ So a wife whose name was Catherine thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if a wife whose name was Catherine sprinkled a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair over the floor a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair would suck up ale nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘that they kept a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair! they have now a good use for a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair.’ So away a wife whose name was Catherine went for a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair: but a wife whose name was Catherine managed to set a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair down just upon a large jug, and upset a large jug; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah! well,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then a wife whose name was Catherine strewed a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with a wife whose name was Catherine's cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean the cellar looks!’ At noon a man called Frederick came home. ‘Now, a wife whose name was Catherine,’ cried a man called Frederick, ‘what have a wife whose name was Catherine for dinner?’ ‘a man called Frederick!’ answered a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘a wife whose name was Catherine was cooking a man called Frederick a steak; but while a wife whose name was Catherine went down to draw the ale, The dog ran away with the ale; and while a wife whose name was Catherine ran after The dog, the ale ran out; and when a wife whose name was Catherine went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that they got at the last fair, a wife whose name was Catherine upset a large jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said a man called Frederick, ‘how could a wife whose name was Catherine do all this?’ Why did a wife whose name was Catherine leave a nice steak, which was all the meat she had to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, a man called Frederick,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘a wife whose name was Catherine did not know a wife whose name was Catherine was doing wrong; a man called Frederick should have told a wife whose name was Catherine before.’ a man called Frederick thought to a man called Frederick, ‘If a wife whose name was Catherine manages matters thus, a man called Frederick must look sharp a man called Frederick.’ Now a man called Frederick had a good deal of gold in the house: so a man called Frederick said to a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! a man called Frederick shall put these into a box and bury these in the garden; but take care that a wife whose name was Catherine never go near or meddle with these.’ ‘No, a man called Frederick,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘that a wife whose name was Catherine never will.’ As soon as a man called Frederick was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes asked a wife whose name was Catherine whether a wife whose name was Catherine would buy. ‘Oh dear a wife whose name was Catherine, a wife whose name was Catherine should like to buy very much, but a wife whose name was Catherine have no money: if some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes had any use for yellow buttons, a wife whose name was Catherine might deal with some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes.’ ‘Yellow buttons!’ said some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes: ‘let some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes have a look at yellow buttons.’ ‘Go into the garden and dig where a wife whose name was Catherine tell some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes will find yellow buttons: a wife whose name was Catherine dare not go a wife whose name was Catherine.’ So some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes went: and when some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes found what yellow buttons were, some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes took yellow buttons away, and left a wife whose name was Catherine's plenty of plates and dishes.

But a wife whose name was Catherine said a wife whose name was Catherine supposed that some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes knew the road, and would follow a wife whose name was Catherine, and a wife whose name was Catherine could not stay there all day waiting for some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes. At last a wife whose name was Catherine overtook a man called Fredericka wife whose name was Catherine a man called Frederick . Then a wife whose name was Catherine gave a man called Frederick the dry bread. ‘Where are some butter and cheese?’ said a man called Frederick. ‘Oh!’ answered a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘a wife whose name was Catherine used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so a wife whose name was Catherine sent the other after one of the cheeses to find one of the cheeses, and a wife whose name was Catherine suppose some butter and cheese are both on the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose a wife whose name was Catherine are to do such silly things!’ said a man called Frederick. ‘How can a man called Frederick say so?’ said a wife whose name was Catherine; ‘a wife whose name was Catherine am sure a man called Frederick never told a wife whose name was Catherine not.’ we ate the dry bread together; and a man called Frederick said, ‘Kate, a man called Frederick hope Kate locked the door safe when Kate came away.’ ‘No,’ answered a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘a man called Frederick did not tell a wife whose name was Catherine.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’ said a man called Frederick, ‘and bring with Kate something to eat.’ a wife whose name was Catherine did as a man called Frederick told a wife whose name was Catherine, and thought to a wife whose name was Catherine by the way, ‘a man called Frederick wants something to eat; but a wife whose name was Catherine don’t think a man called Frederick is very fond of butter and cheese: a wife whose name was Catherine’ll bring a man called Frederick a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for a wife whose name was Catherine have often seen a man called Frederick take some.’ When a wife whose name was Catherine reached home, a wife whose name was Catherine bolted the back door, but the door a wife whose name was Catherine took off the hinges, and said, ‘a man called Frederick told a wife whose name was Catherine to lock the door, but surely the door can nowhere be so safe if a wife whose name was Catherine take the door with a wife whose name was Catherine.’ So a wife whose name was Catherine took a wife whose name was Catherine's time by the way; and when a wife whose name was Catherine overtook a wife whose name was Catherine's a wife whose name was Catherine cried out, ‘There, a man called Frederick, there is the door, a man called Frederick may watch the door as carefully as a man called Frederick please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said a man called Frederick, ‘what a clever wife a man called Frederick have! a man called Frederick sent a wife whose name was Catherine to make the house fast, and a wife whose name was Catherine take the door away, so that everybody may go in and out as everybody please--however, as a wife whose name was Catherine have brought the door, a wife whose name was Catherine shall carry the door about with a wife whose name was Catherine for a wife whose name was Catherine's pains.’ ‘Very well,’ answered a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘a wife whose name was Catherine’ll carry the door; but a wife whose name was Catherine’ll not carry a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar also--carry would be too much of a load; so if a man called Frederick please, a wife whose name was Catherine’ll fasten a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar to the door.’ a man called Frederick of course made no objection to fasten, and they set off into the wood to look for some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes; but they could not find some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.

Then a man called Frederick climbed up again, and tried to hit some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes on the head with some stones: but some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes only said, ‘It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’ a wife whose name was Catherinea wife whose name was Catherine's , began to be very tired; but a wife whose name was Catherine thought it was a bag of fine nuts the door that were so heavy: so a wife whose name was Catherine said softly, ‘a man called Frederick, a wife whose name was Catherine must let a bag of fine nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered a man called Frederick, ‘not now, some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes will discover they.’ ‘a man called Frederick can’t help discover: some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes must go.’ ‘Well, then, make haste and throw a bag of fine nuts down, if a man called Frederick will.’ Then away rattled a bag of fine nuts down among the boughs and one of some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes cried, ‘Bless one of the thieves, it is hailing.’ A little while after, a wife whose name was Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so a wife whose name was Catherine whispered to a man called Frederick, ‘a wife whose name was Catherine must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray don’t,’ answered a man called Frederick, ‘the door will discover they.’ ‘a man called Frederick can’t help discover,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine, ‘go the door must.’ So a wife whose name was Catherine poured the vinegar down; and some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’ At last it popped into a wife whose name was Catherine's head that it was the door that was so heavy all the time: so a wife whose name was Catherine whispered, ‘a man called Frederick, a wife whose name was Catherine must throw the door down soon.’ But a man called Frederick begged and prayed a wife whose name was Catherine not to do so, for a man called Frederick was sure the door would betray they. ‘Here goes, however,’ said a wife whose name was Catherine: and down went the door with such a clatter upon some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, that some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes cried out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes could, and left all the gold. So when they came down, there they found all they's money safe and sound.","[[[3, 6], [8, 8], [27, 27], [33, 33], [43, 43], [46, 46], [52, 52], [399, 399], [573, 573], [584, 584], [595, 596], [606,

30,SWEETHEART ROLAND,"There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated, because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my child,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s head off. When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland, ‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she hurried away with her lover. When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch cried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am warming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah, here in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child, whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore, threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to you while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground. As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved. But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down.’ It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.’ The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned, he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story, and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she answered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd. And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated, and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began.","There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one a woman who was a real witch loved because one ugly and wicked was a woman who was a real witch's own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and one beautiful and good a woman who was a real witch hated, because one beautiful and good was a woman who was a real witch's stepdaughter. her stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that the other became envious, and told the other's that the other must and would have a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious. ‘Be quiet, the other,’ said a woman who was a real witch, ‘and the other shall have a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious. the other's has long deserved death; tonight when her stepdaughter is asleep a woman who was a real witch will come and cut her stepdaughter's head off. Only be careful that the other are at the far side of the bed, and push her stepdaughter well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the other if the other had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything. All day long the other dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, one ugly and wicked got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when one ugly and wicked was asleep, the other pushed one ugly and wicked gently to the front, and took for the other the place at the back, close by the wall. In the night, a woman who was a real witch came creeping in, a woman who was a real witch held an axe in a woman who was a real witch's right hand, and felt with a woman who was a real witch left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then a woman who was a real witch grasped an axe with both hands, and cut her head off. When a woman who was a real witch had gone away, the other got up and went to the other's sweetheart, who was called Roland, and knocked at her sweetheart, who was called Roland's door. When her sweetheart, who was called Roland came out, the other said to her sweetheart, who was called Roland: ‘Listen, her sweetheart, who was called Roland, we must fly in all haste; the other's wanted to kill the other, but has struck her stepdaughter. When daylight comes, and a woman who was a real witch sees what a woman who was a real witch has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said her sweetheart, who was called Roland, ‘her sweetheart, who was called Roland counsel the other first to take away a woman who was a real witch's magic wand, or we cannot escape if a woman who was a real witch pursues we.’ the other fetched her magic wand, and the other took her head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then the other hurried away with her sweetheart, who was called Roland. When a woman who was a real witch got up next morning, a woman who was a real witch called one ugly and wicked, and wanted to give one ugly and wicked a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, but one ugly and wicked did not come. Then a woman who was a real witch cried: ‘Where are one ugly and wicked?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, a woman who was a real witch am sweeping,’ answered the first drop of blood. a woman who was a real witch went out, but saw no one on the stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are one ugly and wicked?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, a woman who was a real witch am warming a woman who was a real witch,’ cried the second drop of blood. a woman who was a real witch went into the kitchen, but found no one. Then a woman who was a real witch cried again: ‘Where are one ugly and wicked?’ ‘Ah, here in the bed, a woman who was a real witch am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. a woman who was a real witch went into the room to the bed. What did a woman who was a real witch see there? her stepdaughter, bathed in a woman who was a real witch's blood. a woman who was a real witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as a woman who was a real witch could look forth quite far into the world, a woman who was a real witch perceived the other hurrying away with her sweetheart, who was called Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried a woman who was a real witch, ‘even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape a woman who was a real witch.’ a woman who was a real witch put on a woman who was a real witch's many-league boots, in which a woman who was a real witch covered an hour’s walk at every step, and it was not long before a woman who was a real witch overtook you. the other, however, when the other saw a woman who was a real witch striding towards the other, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart, who was called Roland into a lake, and the other into a duck swimming in the middle of a lake. a woman who was a real witch placed a woman who was a real witch on the shore, threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice a duck swimming in the middle of it; but a duck swimming in the middle of it did not let a duck swimming in the middle of it be enticed, and a woman who was a real witch had to go home at night as a woman who was a real witch had come. At this the other and her sweetheart, who was called Roland resumed the girl and her sweetheart Roland's natural shapes again, and the girl and her sweetheart Roland walked on the whole night until daybreak. Then the other changed the other into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart, who was called Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before a woman who was a real witch came striding up towards the girl and her sweetheart Roland, and said to a fiddler: ‘a fiddler, may a woman who was a real witch pluck a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge for a woman who was a real witch?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ a fiddler replied, ‘a fiddler will play to a woman who was a real witch while a woman who was a real witch do pluck.’ As a woman who was a real witch was hastily creeping into a briar hedge and was just going to pluck a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, knowing perfectly well who a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge was, a fiddler began to play, and whether a woman who was a real witch would or not, a woman who was a real witch was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster a fiddler played, the more violent springs was a woman who was a real witch forced to make, and the thorns tore a woman who was a real witch's clothes from a woman who was a real witch's body, and pricked a woman who was a real witch and wounded a woman who was a real witch till a woman who was a real witch bled, and as a fiddler did not stop, a woman who was a real witch had to dance till a woman who was a real witch lay dead on the ground. As the girl and her sweetheart Roland were now set free, her sweetheart, who was called Roland said: ‘Now her sweetheart, who was called Roland will go to her sweetheart, who was called Roland's father and arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime a woman who was a real witch will stay here and wait for her sweetheart, who was called Roland,’ said the other, ‘and that no one may recognize a woman who was a real witch, a woman who was a real witch will change a woman who was a real witch into a red stone landmark.’ Then her sweetheart, who was called Roland went away, and the other stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her sweetheart, who was called Roland. But when her sweetheart, who was called Roland got home, her sweetheart, who was called Roland fell into the snares of another, who so fascinated her sweetheart, who was called Roland that her sweetheart, who was called Roland forgot the other. the other remained there a long time, but at length, as her sweetheart, who was called Roland did not return at all, the other was sad, and changed the other into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come this way, and trample the other down.’ It befell, however, that a shepherd kept a shepherd's sheep in the field and saw a flower, and as a flower was so pretty, plucked a flower, took a flower with a shepherd, and laid a flower away in a shepherd's chest. From that time forth, strange things happened in a shepherd's house. When a shepherd arose in the morning, all the work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when a shepherd came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. a shepherd could not conceive how this came to pass, for a shepherd never saw a human being in the shepherd’s house, and no one could have concealed no one in the shepherd’s house. a shepherd was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last a shepherd was so afraid that a shepherd went to a wise woman and asked for a wise woman's advice. a wise woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is moving in the room, and if a shepherd see anything, no matter what anything is, throw a white cloth over anything, and then the magic will be stopped.’ a shepherd did as a wise woman bade a shepherd, and next morning just as day dawned, a shepherd saw his chest open, and a flower come out. Swiftly a shepherd sprang towards a flower, and threw a white cloth over a flower. Instantly the transformation came to an end, and the other stood before a shepherd, who admitted to a shepherd that the other had been the flower, and that up to this time the other had attended to a shepherd's house-keeping. the other told a shepherd the other's story, and as the other pleased a shepherd a shepherd asked the other if the other would marry a shepherd, but the other answered: ‘No,’ for the other wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart, who was called Roland, although her sweetheart, who was called Roland had deserted the other. Nevertheless, the other promised not to go away, but to continue keeping house for a shepherd. And now the time drew near when her sweetheart, who was called Roland's wedding was to be celebrated, and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced that all the girls were to be present at Roland’s wedding, and sing in honour of the bridal pair. When the other heard of this, the other grew so sad that the other thought the other's heart would break, and the other would not go thither, but the other girls came and took the other. When it came to the other's turn to sing, the other stepped back, until at last the other was the only one left, and then the other could not refuse. But when the other began the other's song, and her song reached her sweetheart, who was called Roland's ears, her sweetheart, who was called Roland sprang up and cried: ‘her sweetheart, who was called Roland know the voice, that is the other, her sweetheart, who was called Roland will have no other!’ Everything her sweetheart, who was called Roland had forgotten, and which had vanished from her sweetheart, who was called Roland's mind, had suddenly come home again to her sweetheart, who was called Roland's heart. Then the other held Roland’s wedding with her sweetheart, who was called Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began.","[[[6, 12], [26, 26], [31, 31], [44, 44], [50, 50], [74, 75], [89, 89], [94, 96], [117, 117], [192, 194], [244, 246], [251, 251], [256, 256], [263, 263], [277, 277], [287, 287], [295, 295], [344, 345], [354, 354], [363, 363], [366, 366], [391, 391], [401, 401], [458, 460], [466, 466], [468, 468], [486, 487], [503, 503], [515, 517], [545, 545], [548, 548], [558, 558], [570, 570], [588, 588], [600, 600], [611, 611], [615, 615], [621, 621], [628, 628], [631, 632], [645, 645], [655, 655], [657, 657], [675, 675], [693, 693], [696, 696], [699, 699], [707, 707], [723, 723], [735, 737], [745, 745], [768, 769], [771, 771], [801, 803], [811, 811], [871, 872], [890, 890], [896, 896], [913, 913], [915, 915], [921, 921], [952, 952], [957, 957], [980, 980], [989, 989], [992, 992], [997, 997], [1000, 1000], [1002, 1002], [1012, 1012], [1017, 1017], [1054, 1054], [1075, 1075], [1077, 1077], [1080, 1080]], [[18, 21], [29, 29], [192, 195], [212, 212], [219, 219], [468, 469], [475, 475], [480, 480], [493, 493], [536, 536], [577, 577]], [[36, 39], [42, 43], [48, 48]], [[50, 51], [53, 54], [105, 106], [114, 114], [122, 122], [142, 142], [287, 290], [354, 356], [416, 419], [615, 624]], [[62, 63], [68, 68], [74, 74], [77, 77], [89, 90], [100, 100], [105, 105], [130, 130], [156, 158], [160, 160], [178, 178], [216, 217], [228, 228], [300, 301], [307, 307], [326, 326], [344, 344], [349, 349], [386, 386], [406, 407], [414, 414], [450, 450], [454, 454], [657, 658], [662, 662], [727, 728], [733, 733], [740, 740], [749, 749], [757, 757], [817, 818], [820, 820], [840, 841], [843, 843], [859, 859], [1065, 1066], [1094, 1095], [1107, 1107], [1131, 1132], [1134, 1136], [1155, 1155], [1161, 1161], [1179, 1179], [1464, 1466], [1476, 1476], [1488, 1488], [1497, 1497], [1500, 1500], [1505, 1505], [1510, 1510], [1512, 1512], [1518, 1518], [1526, 1526], [1532, 1532], [1540, 1540], [1544, 1544], [1611, 1613], [1618, 1618], [1623, 1623], [1625, 1625], [1631, 1631], [1644, 1644], [1650, 1650], [1655, 1655], [1662, 1662], [1671, 1671], [1678, 1678], [1680, 1680], [1704, 1706], [1738, 1740], [1742, 1742], [1745, 1745]], [[57, 70], [82, 83], [103, 103], [476, 477]], [[145, 146], [222, 223]], [[253, 254], [279, 280]], [[122, 123], [287, 291], [416, 420]], [[307, 313], [318, 318], [322, 322], [329, 329], [334, 335], [381, 381], [384, 384], [454, 455], [662, 664], [749, 751], [820, 822], [859, 861], [1031, 1031], [1036, 1036], [1040, 1040], [1061, 1061], [1089, 1089], [1107, 1108], [1112, 1112], [1116, 1116], [1127, 1127], [1129, 1129], [1148, 1148], [1532, 1534], [1537, 1537], [1567, 1568], [1686, 1687], [1690, 1690], [1697, 1697], [1708, 1708], [1716, 1716], [1725, 1725], [1734, 1734], [1745, 1747]], [[337, 337], [370, 370], [396, 396], [403, 403]], [[391, 393], [409, 411], [745, 747]], [[137, 138], [435, 436]], [[446, 447], [500, 501], [526, 527]], [[440, 441], [542, 543], [561, 562]], [[585, 586], [606, 607]], [[671, 671], [680, 680], [688, 688], [725, 725]], [[753, 754], [766, 766]], [[759, 766], [787, 788], [791, 792], [796, 796]], [[817, 822], [824, 824], [830, 830], [877, 877], [1025, 1025]], [[863, 864], [882, 883], [886, 887], [905, 905], [909, 909], [945, 945], [972, 972], [1007, 1007]], [[845, 856], [892, 894], [934, 935], [941, 942]], [[891, 891], [917, 917]], [[854, 856], [926, 927]], [[1189, 1190], [1192, 1192], [1215, 1215], [1222, 1222], [1234, 1236], [1240, 1240], [1283, 1283], [1298, 1298], [1309, 1309], [1316, 1316], [1329, 1329], [1342, 1342], [1347, 1347], [1387, 1387], [1413, 1414], [1419, 1419], [1429, 1429], [1442, 1442], [1469, 1469], [1474, 1474], [1492, 1492], [1499, 1499], [1507, 1507], [1508, 1508], [1515, 1515], [1557, 1558]], [[1163, 1164], [1199, 1200], [1204, 1204], [1210, 1210], [1213, 1213], [1219, 1219], [1436, 1437], [1445, 1445], [1453, 1453]], [[1234, 1237], [1316, 1317], [1327, 1327]], [[1320, 1321], [1325, 1325]], [[1350, 1352], [1356, 1356], [1359, 1361], [1417, 1417]], [[1389, 1389], [1394, 1394], [1402, 1402]], [[1222, 1223], [1431, 1432]], [[1567, 1569], [1599, 1599], [1742, 1743]], [[1680, 1681], [1684, 1684]]]"
31,SNOWDROP,"It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop. But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon herself in it, and say:  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!   Of all the ladies in the land,   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’ And the glass had always answered:  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’ But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as usual:  ‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,   But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’ When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her. Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep. By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold. They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not right. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second, ‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth, ‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with my knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone. In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in.’ But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and said:  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!   Of all the ladies in the land,   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’ And the glass answered:  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,   Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,   There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she   Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’ Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her. And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all colours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door. ‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home. In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.’ When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said:  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,   Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,   There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she   Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’ Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may lie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone. Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’ ‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:  ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’ And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be. When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side. And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe with me.’ Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding. To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said:  ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!   Of all the ladies in the land,   Who is fairest, tell me, who?’ And the glass answered:  ‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;   But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’ When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.","It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at the queen of a country many thousand miles off's window. The frame of her window was made of fine black ebony, and as the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat looking out upon the snow, the queen of a country many thousand miles off pricked the queen of a country many thousand miles off's finger, and three drops of blood fell upon her finger. Then the queen of a country many thousand miles off gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the snow, and said, ‘Would that the queen of a country many thousand miles off's little daughter may be as white as the snow, as red as blood, and as black as The frame of the window!’ And so my little daughter really did grow up; my little daughter's skin was as white as snow, my little daughter's cheeks as rosy as blood, and my little daughter's hair as black as ebony; and my little daughter was called Snowdrop. But the queen of a country many thousand miles off died; and the king soon married another wife, who became queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that another wife, who became queen could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than another wife, who became queen was. another wife, who became queen had a fairy looking-glass, to which another wife, who became queen used to go, and then another wife, who became queen would gaze upon another wife, who became queen in a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and say:  ‘Tell another wife, who became queen, a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, tell another wife, who became queen true!   Of all the ladies in the land,   Who is fairest, tell another wife, who became queen, who?’ And a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go had always answered:  ‘another wife, who became queen, art the fairest in the land.’ But my little daughter grew more and more beautiful; and when my little daughter was seven years old my little daughter was as bright as the day, and fairer than another wife, who became queen. Then a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go one day answered another wife, who became queen, when another wife, who became queen went to look in a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go as usual:  ‘another wife, who became queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,   But my little daughter is lovelier far than another wife, who became queen!’ When another wife, who became queen heard is another wife, who became queen turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of another wife, who became queen's servants, and said, ‘Take my little daughter away into the wide wood, that another wife, who became queen may never see my little daughter any more.’ Then one of her servants led my little daughter away; but one of her servants's heart melted when my little daughter begged one of her servants to spare my little daughter's life, and one of her servants said, ‘one of her servants will not hurt my little daughter, my little daughter.’ So one of her servants left my little daughter by my little daughter; and though one of her servants thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear my little daughter in pieces, one of her servants felt as if a great weight were taken off one of her servants's heart when one of her servants had made up one of her servants's mind not to kill my little daughter but to leave my little daughter to my little daughter's fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving my little daughter. Then my little daughter wandered along through the wide wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about my little daughter, but none did my little daughter any harm. In the evening my little daughter came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for my little daughter's little feet would carry my little daughter no further. Everything was spruce and neat in a cottage among the hills: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in seven little glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood seven little beds. As my little daughter was very hungry, my little daughter picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that my little daughter thought my little daughter would lie down and rest. So my little daughter tried seven little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited my little daughter: and there my little daughter laid my little daughter down and went to sleep. By and by in came the masters of a cottage among the hills. Now the masters of the cottage were seven little dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold. the masters of the cottage lighted up the masters of the cottage's seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not right. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on The first's stool?’ The second, ‘Who has been eating off The first's plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking The first's bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with The first's spoon?’ The fifth, ‘Who has been handling The first's fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with The first's knife?’ the seventh, ‘Who has been drinking the seventh's wine?’ Then The first looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on The first's bed?’ And the rest came running to The first, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon my bed. But the seventh saw my little daughter, and called all the seventh's brethren to come and see my little daughter; and all his brethren cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought all his brethren's lamps to look at my little daughter, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child my little daughter is!’ And all his brethren were very glad to see my little daughter, and took care not to wake my little daughter; and the seventh slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone. In the morning my little daughter told all his brethren all my little daughter's story; and all his brethren pitied my little daughter, and said if my little daughter would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for all his brethren, my little daughter might stay where my little daughter was, and all his brethren would take good care of my little daughter. Then all his brethren went out all day long to all his brethren's work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but my little daughter was left at home; and all his brethren warned my little daughter, and said, ‘another wife, who became queen will soon find out where my little daughter are, so take care and let no one in.’ But another wife, who became queen, now that another wife, who became queen thought my little daughter was dead, believed that my little daughter must be the handsomest lady in the land; and another wife, who became queen went to another wife, who became queen's glass and said:  ‘Tell another wife, who became queen, her glass, tell another wife, who became queen true!   Of all the ladies in the land,   Who is fairest, tell another wife, who became queen, who?’ And her glass answered:  ‘another wife, who became queen, art the fairest in the land:   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,   Where the seven dwarfs the seven dwarfs's dwelling have made,   There my little daughter is hiding my little daughter's head; and my little daughterIs lovelier far, another wife, who became queen! than another wife, who became queen.’ Then another wife, who became queen was very much frightened; for another wife, who became queen knew that her glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that one of her servants had betrayed another wife, who became queen. And another wife, who became queen could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than another wife, who became queen was; so another wife, who became queen dressed another wife, who became queen up as an old pedlar, and went another wife, who became queen's way over the hills, to the place where the seven dwarfs dwelt. Then another wife, who became queen knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ my little daughter looked out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, another wife, who became queen! what have another wife, who became queen to sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said another wife, who became queen; ‘laces and bobbins of all colours.’ ‘my little daughter will let another wife, who became queen in; another wife, who became queen seems to be a very good sort of body,’ thought my little daughter, as my little daughter ran down and unbolted the door. ‘Bless another wife, who became queen!’ said another wife, who became queen, ‘how badly my little daughter's stays are laced! Let another wife, who became queen lace your stays up with one of another wife, who became queen's nice new laces.’ my little daughter did not dream of any mischief; so my little daughter stood before another wife, who became queen; but another wife, who became queen set to work so nimbly, and pulled one of my nice new laces so tight, that my little daughter's breath was stopped, and my little daughter fell down as if my little daughter were dead. ‘There’s an end to all thy beauty,’ said another wife, who became queen, and went away home. In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved the seven dwarfs were to see the seven dwarfs's stretched out upon the ground, as if my little daughter was quite dead. However, the seven dwarfs lifted my little daughter up, and when the seven dwarfs found what ailed my little daughter, the seven dwarfs cut one of my nice new laces; and in a little time my little daughter began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then the seven dwarfs said, ‘another wife, who became queen was another wife, who became queenanother wife, who became queen; take care another time, and let no one in when the seven dwarfs are away.’ When another wife, who became queen got home, another wife, who became queen went straight to her glass, and spoke to her glass as before; but to another wife, who became queen's great grief her glass still said:  ‘another wife, who became queen, art the fairest in the land:   But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,   Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling their dwelling have made,   There my little daughter is hiding her head; and my little daughterIs lovelier far, another wife, who became queen! than another wife, who became queen.’ Then the blood ran cold in another wife, who became queen's heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and another wife, who became queen dressed another wife, who became queen up again, but in quite another dress from the one another wife, who became queen wore before, and took with another wife, who became queen a poisoned comb. When another wife, who became queen reached their dwelling, another wife, who became queen knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But my little daughter said, ‘my little daughter dare not let anyone in.’ Then another wife, who became queen said, ‘Only look at another wife, who became queen's beautiful combs!’ and gave my little daughter a poisoned comb. And a poisoned comb looked so pretty, that another wife, who became queen took a poisoned comb up and put a poisoned comb into her hair to try a poisoned comb; but the moment a poisoned comb touched her head, the poison was so powerful that another wife, who became queen fell down senseless. ‘There another wife, who became queen may lie,’ said another wife, who became queen, and went another wife, who became queen's way. But by good luck the seven dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when the seven dwarfs saw my little daughter lying on the ground, the seven dwarfs thought what had happened, and soon found a poisoned comb. And when the seven dwarfs took a poisoned comb away another wife, who became queen got well, and told the seven dwarfs all that had passed; and the seven dwarfs warned another wife, who became queen once more not to open the door to anyone. Meantime another wife, who became queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when another wife, who became queen read the very same answer as before; and another wife, who became queen said, ‘my little daughter shall die, if it cost another wife, who became queen her life.’ So another wife, who became queen went by another wife, who became queen into another wife, who became queen's chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted a poisoned apple was sure to die. Then another wife, who became queen dressed another wife, who became queen up as a peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to their dwelling, and knocked at the door; but my little daughter put my little daughter's head out of the window and said, ‘my little daughter dare not let anyone in, for the seven dwarfs have told my little daughter not.’ ‘Do as my little daughter please,’ said another wife, who became queen, ‘but at any rate take a poisoned apple; another wife, who became queen will give a poisoned apple my little daughter.’ ‘No,’ said my little daughter, ‘my little daughter dare not take a poisoned apple.’ ‘my little daughter!’ answered another wife, who became queen, ‘what are my little daughter afraid of? Do my little daughter think a poisoned apple is poisoned? Come! do my little daughter eat one part, and another wife, who became queen will eat the other.’ Now a poisoned apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then my little daughter was much tempted to taste, for a poisoned apple looked so very nice; and when my little daughter saw another wife, who became queen eat, my little daughter could wait no longer. But my little daughter had scarcely put the piece into my little daughter's mouth, when my little daughter fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save my little daughter,’ said another wife, who became queen; and another wife, who became queen went home to another wife, who became queen's glass, and at last her glass said:  ‘another wife, who became queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’ And then another wife, who became queen's wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be. When evening came, and the seven dwarfs had gone home, the seven dwarfs found my little daughter lying on the ground: no breath came from my little daughter's lips, and the seven dwarfs were afraid that my little daughter was quite dead. the seven dwarfs lifted my little daughter up, and combed her hair, and washed my little daughter's face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for my little daughter seemed quite dead. So the seven dwarfs laid my little daughter down upon a bier, and the seven dwarfs watched and bewailed my little daughter's three whole days; and then the seven dwarfs thought the seven dwarfs would bury my little daughter: but my little daughter's cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as her face did while my little daughter was alive; so the seven dwarfs said, ‘the seven dwarfs will never bury my little daughter in the cold ground.’ And the seven dwarfs made a coffin of glass, so that the seven dwarfs might still look at my little daughter, and wrote upon a coffin of glass in golden letters what my little daughter's name was, and that my little daughter was a king’s daughter. And a coffin of glass was set among the hills, and one of the seven dwarfs always sat by a coffin of glass and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned my little daughter; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by my little daughter's side. And thus my little daughter lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though my little daughter was asleep; for my little daughter was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at their dwelling; and a prince saw my little daughter, and read what was written in golden letters. Then a prince offered the seven dwarfs money, and prayed and besought the seven dwarfs to let a prince take my little daughter away; but the seven dwarfs said, ‘the seven dwarfs will not part with my little daughter for all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, the seven dwarfs had pity on a prince, and gave a prince a coffin of glass; but the moment a prince lifted a coffin of glass up to carry a coffin of glass home with a prince, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and my little daughter awoke, and said, ‘Where am my little daughter?’ And a prince said, ‘my little daughter art quite safe with a prince.’ Then a prince told my little daughter all that had happened, and said, ‘a prince love my little daughter far better than all the world; so come with a prince to a prince's father’s palace, and my little daughter shall be a prince's wife.’ And my little daughter consented, and went home with a prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding. To the feast was asked, among the rest, my little daughter's old enemy the queen; and as my little daughter was dressing my little daughter in fine rich clothes, my little daughter looked in the glass and said:  ‘Tell my little daughter, the glass, tell my little daughter true!   Of all the ladies in the land,   Who is fairest, tell my little daughter, who?’ And the glass answered:  ‘my little daughter, art loveliest here, I ween;   But lovelier far is my little daughter.’ When Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen heard this Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen started with rage; but Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen's envy and curiosity were so great, that Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen could not help setting out to see my little daughter. And when Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen got there, and saw that it was no other than my little daughterSnowdrop’s old enemy the queen , Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen choked with rage, and fell down and died: but their lived and reigned happily over the land many, many years; and sometimes their went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the seven dwarfs.","[[[18, 26], [30, 30], [47, 47],

32,THE PINK,"There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children. Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness. Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over. The cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with a garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for. After a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however, that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once more said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in your bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in and said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the plate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence. You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and looked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him. And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had none at all for years. Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are so clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it, and said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king replied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said: ‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it. Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so. And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower, to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was led in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.","There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children. Every morning a queen to whom God had given no children went into the garden and prayed to God to bestow on a queen to whom God had given no children a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to a queen to whom God had given no children and said: ‘Be at rest, a queen to whom God had given no children shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world a son with the power of wishing wishes for, whatsoever in the world he wishes for shall a son with the power of wishing have.’ Then a queen to whom God had given no children went to the king, and told the king the joyful tidings, and when the time was come a queen to whom God had given no children gave birth to a son with the power of wishing, and the king was filled with gladness.

It happened once when a son with the power of wishing was a little older, that a son with the power of wishing was lying in a queen to whom God had given no children's arms and a queen to whom God had given no children fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that a son with the power of wishing had the power of wishing, and stole a son with the power of wishing away, and the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing took a hen, and cut a hen in pieces, and dropped some of a hen's blood on a queen to whom God had given no children apron and on a queen to whom God had given no children's dress. Then the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing carried a son with the power of wishing away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle a son with the power of wishing, and the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing ran to the king and accused a queen to whom God had given no children of having allowed a son with the power of wishing to be taken from a queen to whom God had given no children by the wild beasts.

Now will a son with the power of wishing pronounce the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing's sentence. the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing's neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing's throat.’ And when a son with the power of wishing had spoken these words, the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round your neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and some live coals the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing ate, until the flames broke forth from your throat. the king's remained there a short while longer, and a son with the power of wishing thought of a son with the power of wishing's , and wondered if a queen to whom God had given no children were still alive. At length a son with the power of wishing said to a queen to whom God had given no children: ‘a son with the power of wishing will go home to a son with the power of wishing's own country; if a queen to whom God had given no children will go with a son with the power of wishing, a son with the power of wishing will provide for a queen to whom God had given no children.’ ‘Ah,’ a queen to whom God had given no children replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall a queen to whom God had given no children do in a strange land where a queen to whom God had given no children am unknown?’ As a queen to whom God had given no children did not seem quite willing, and as The two could not be parted from each other, a son with the power of wishing wished that a queen to whom God had given no children might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took a queen to whom God had given no children with a son with the power of wishing. Then a son with the power of wishing went away to my own country, and the poodle had to run after a son with the power of wishing. a son with the power of wishing went to the tower in which a son with the power of wishing's was confined, and as the tower in which his mother was confined was so high, a son with the power of wishing wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then a son with the power of wishing mounted up and looked inside, and cried: ‘a queen to whom God had given no childrena queen to whom God had given no children, are a queen to whom God had given no children still alive, or are a queen to whom God had given no children dead?’ a queen to whom God had given no children answered: ‘a queen to whom God had given no children have just eaten, and am still satisfied,’ for a queen to whom God had given no children thought the angels were there. Said a son with the power of wishing: ‘a son with the power of wishing am a queen to whom God had given no children's dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from her arms; but a son with the power of wishing am alive still, and will soon set a queen to whom God had given no children free.’ Then a son with the power of wishing descended again, and went to the king, and caused a son with the power of wishing to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if the king could offer the king service. the king said yes, if a son with the power of wishing was skilful and could get game for the king, a son with the power of wishing should come to the king, but that deer had never taken up that deer's quarters in any part of the district or country. Then a son with the power of wishing promised to procure as much game for a son with the power of wishing as a son with the power of wishing could possibly use at the royal table. So a son with the power of wishing summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade all the huntsmen go out into the forest with a son with the power of wishing. And a son with the power of wishing went with all the huntsmen and made all the huntsmen form a great circle, open at one end where a son with the power of wishing stationed a son with the power of wishing, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running inside a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself at once, and all the huntsmen shot Two hundred deer and more. Then all the huntsmen were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the king, and for once the king was able to deck the royal table with game, after having had none at all for years. Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that the king's entire household should eat with the king next day, and made a great feast. When his entire household were all assembled together, the king said to a son with the power of wishing: ‘As a son with the power of wishing are so clever, a son with the power of wishing shall sit by the king.’ a son with the power of wishing replied: ‘the king, the king must excuse a son with the power of wishing, a son with the power of wishing am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on sit, and said: ‘a son with the power of wishing shall sit by the king,’ until a son with the power of wishing did sit. Whilst a son with the power of wishing was sitting there, a son with the power of wishing thought of a son with the power of wishing's , and wished that one of the king's principal servants would begin to speak of a queen to whom God had given no children, and would ask how it was faring with a queen to whom God had given no children in a high tower, and if a queen to whom God had given no children were alive still, or had perished. Hardly had a son with the power of wishing formed the wish than the marshal began, and said: ‘the king, we live joyously here, but how is a queen to whom God had given no children living in a high tower? Is a queen to whom God had given no children still alive, or has a queen to whom God had given no children died?’ But the king replied: ‘a queen to whom God had given no children let the king's be torn to pieces by wild beasts; the king will not have a queen to whom God had given no children named.’ Then a son with the power of wishing arose and said: ‘the king a queen to whom God had given no children is alive still, and a son with the power of wishing am a queen to whom God had given no children's son, and a son with the power of wishing was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore a son with the power of wishing from her arms when a queen to whom God had given no children was asleep, and sprinkled the queen’s apron with the blood of a chicken.’ Thereupon a son with the power of wishing took the dog with the golden collar, and said: ‘the dog with the golden collar is that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and live coals the dog with the golden collar was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from the dog with the golden collar's . On this a son with the power of wishing asked the king if the king would like to see the dog with the golden collar in the dog with the golden collar's true shape, and wished the dog with the golden collar back into the form of a queen to whom God had given no children, in which the dog with the golden collar stood immediately, with the dog with the golden collar's , and the dog with the golden collar's knife by the dog with the golden collar's side. When the king saw the dog with the golden collar the king fell into a passion, and ordered the dog with the golden collar to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then a son with the power of wishing spoke further and said: ‘the king, will the king see a queen to whom God had given no childrena son with the power of wishing a son with the power of wishingmurdera queen to whom God had given no children's murder?’ the king replied: ‘Yes, the king would like to see a queen to whom God had given no children.’ a son with the power of wishing said: ‘the king, a son with the power of wishing will show a queen to whom God had given no children to the king in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and a son with the power of wishing thrust a son with the power of wishing's hand into a son with the power of wishing's pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed the pink on the royal table, and the pink was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal the pink. Then a son with the power of wishing said: ‘Now will a son with the power of wishing show a queen to whom God had given no children to the king in a queen to whom God had given no children's own form,’ and wished that a queen to whom God had given no children might become a maiden, and a queen to whom God had given no children stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made a queen to whom God had given no children look more so. And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into a high tower, to fetch a queen to whom God had given no children and bring a queen to whom God had given no children to the royal table. But when a queen to whom God had given no children was led in a queen to whom God had given no children ate nothing, and said: ‘Goda high tower, will soon set a queen to whom God had given no children free.’ a queen to whom God had given no children lived three days more, and then died happily, and when a queen to whom God had given no children was buried, the two white doves which had brought a queen to whom God had given no children's food to a high tower, and were angels of heaven, followed a queen to whom God had given no children's body and seated the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven on a queen to whom God had given no children's grave. the king ordered the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king own heart, and the king soon died. the king's married a queen to whom God had given no childrena son with the power of wishing a son with the power of wishing a son with the power of wishing's , and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.","[[[6, 14], [18, 18], [32, 32], [46, 46], [55, 55], [83, 83], [102, 102], [119, 119], [136, 136], [159,

33,CLEVER ELSIE,"There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’ said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans; but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’ ‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there. Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink, but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while, as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’ When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her. After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep. Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought: ‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’ answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said: ‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her since.","There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And when a daughter who was called Clever Elsie had grown up a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie said: ‘We will get a daughter who was called Clever Elsie married.’ ‘Yes,’ said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.’ At length a man came from a distance and wooed a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, who was called Hans; but a man stipulated that a daughter who was called Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, ‘a daughter who was called Clever Elsie has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh, a daughter who was called Clever Elsie can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’ ‘Well,’ said a man, ‘if a daughter who was called Clever Elsie is not really smart, a man won’t have a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.’ When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as a daughter who was called Clever Elsie went, so that the time might not appear long. When a daughter who was called Clever Elsie was below a daughter who was called Clever Elsie fetched a daughter who was called Clever Elsie a chair, and set a chair before the barrel so that a daughter who was called Clever Elsie had no need to stoop, and did not hurt a daughter who was called Clever Elsie back or do a daughter who was called Clever Elsie any unexpected injury.

Then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If a daughter who was called Clever Elsie get a man, and we have a child, and a child grows big, and we send a child into the cellar to draw beer, then a pick-axe will fall on a child's head and kill a child.’ Then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of a daughter who was called Clever Elsie's body, over the misfortune which lay before a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. Those upstairs waited for the drink, but a daughter who was called Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the mother said to the servant: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where a daughter who was called Clever Elsie is.’ the servant went and found a daughter who was called Clever Elsie sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘a daughter who was called Clever Elsie why do a daughter who was called Clever Elsie weep?’ asked the servant. ‘Ah,’ a daughter who was called Clever Elsie answered, ‘have a daughter who was called Clever Elsie not reason to weep? If a daughter who was called Clever Elsie get a man, and we have a child, and a child grows big, and has to draw beer here, a pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill a child.’ Then said the servant: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down beside a daughter who was called Clever Elsie and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while, as the servant did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where a daughter who was called Clever Elsie and a daughter who was called Clever Elsie are.’ the boy went down, and there sat Elsie and the girl. Then the boy asked: ‘Why are Elsie and the girl weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, ‘have a daughter who was called Clever Elsie not reason to weep? If a daughter who was called Clever Elsie get a man, and we have a child, and a child grows big, and has to draw beer here, a pick-axe will fall on a child's and kill a child.’ Then said the boy: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, and likewise began to howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as the boy still did not return, the man said to the mother: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where a daughter who was called Clever Elsie is!’ the mother went down, and found Elsie and the girl in the midst of Elsie and the girl's lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie told the mother also that a child was to be killed by a pick-axe, when a pick-axe grew big and had to draw beer, and a pick-axe fell down. Then said the mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept with Elsie and the girl. the man waited a short time, but as the man's wife did not come back and the man's thirst grew ever greater, the man said: ‘the man must go into the cellar the man and see where a daughter who was called Clever Elsie is.’ But when the man got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and the man heard the reason, and that a child was the cause, and a daughter who was called Clever Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that a child might be killed by a pick-axe, if a child should happen to be sitting beneath a pick-axe, drawing beer just at the very time when a pick-axe fell down, the man cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat down, and likewise wept with they. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for a long time; then as no one would come back The bridegroom thought: ‘They must be waiting for the man below: the man too must go there and see what They are about.’ When a man got down, they were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened then?’ asked a man. ‘Ah, a man,’ said a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, ‘if we marry each other and have a child, and a child is big, and we perhaps send a child here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash a child's brains out if the pick-axe which has been left up there were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?’ ‘Come,’ said a man, ‘more understanding than that is not needed for a man's household, as a daughter who was called Clever Elsie are such a clever Elsie, a man will have a daughter who was called Clever Elsie,’ and seized a daughter who was called Clever Elsie's hand, took a daughter who was called Clever Elsie upstairs with a man, and married a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. After a man had had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie some time, a man said: ‘a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, a man am going out to work and earn some money for we; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, a man, a daughter who was called Clever Elsie will do cut.’ After a man had gone away, a daughter who was called Clever Elsie cooked a daughter who was called Clever Elsie some good broth and took some good broth into the field with a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. When a daughter who was called Clever Elsie came to the field a daughter who was called Clever Elsie said to a daughter who was called Clever Elsie: ‘What shall a daughter who was called Clever Elsie do; shall a daughter who was called Clever Elsie cut first, or shall a daughter who was called Clever Elsie eat first? Oh, a daughter who was called Clever Elsie will eat first.’ Then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie drank some good broth and when a daughter who was called Clever Elsie was fully satisfied, a daughter who was called Clever Elsie once more said: ‘What shall a daughter who was called Clever Elsie do? Shall a daughter who was called Clever Elsie cut first, or shall a daughter who was called Clever Elsie sleep first? a daughter who was called Clever Elsie will sleep first.’ Then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie lay down among the corn and fell asleep. a man had been at home for a long time, but a daughter who was called Clever Elsie did not come; then said a man: ‘What a clever Elsie a man have; a daughter who was called Clever Elsie is so industrious that a daughter who was called Clever Elsie does not even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and a daughter who was called Clever Elsie still stayed away, a man went out to see what a daughter who was called Clever Elsie had cut, but nothing was cut, and a daughter who was called Clever Elsie was lying among the corn asleep. Then a man hastened home and brought a fowler’s net with little bells and hung a fowler’s net with little bells round about a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, and a daughter who was called Clever Elsie still went on sleeping. Then a man ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in a man's chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, a daughter who was called Clever Elsie awoke and when a daughter who was called Clever Elsie got up there was a jingling all round about a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, and the bells rang at each step which a daughter who was called Clever Elsie took. Then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie was alarmed, and became uncertain whether a daughter who was called Clever Elsie really was a daughter who was called Clever Elsie or not, and said: ‘Is it a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, or is it not a daughter who was called Clever Elsie?’ But a daughter who was called Clever Elsie knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length a daughter who was called Clever Elsie thought: ‘a daughter who was called Clever Elsie will go home and ask if it be a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, or if it be not a daughter who was called Clever Elsie, They will be sure to know.’ a daughter who was called Clever Elsie ran to the door of a daughter who was called Clever Elsie's own house, but the door of her own house was shut; then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie knocked at the window and cried: ‘a man, is a daughter who was called Clever Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’ answered a man, ‘a daughter who was called Clever Elsie is within.’ Hereupon a daughter who was called Clever Elsie was terrified, and said: ‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not a daughter who was called Clever Elsie,’ and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells the people would not open another door, and a daughter who was called Clever Elsie could get in nowhere. Then a daughter who was called Clever Elsie ran out of the village, and no one has seen a daughter who was called Clever Elsie since.","[[[7, 13], [17, 17], [21, 21], [29, 29], [50, 50], [63, 63], [74, 75], [90, 90], [106, 106], [132, 132], [142, 142], [160, 160], [173, 174], [193, 193], [206, 206], [209, 209], [211, 211], [223, 223], [234, 234], [238, 238], [244, 244], [249, 249], [262, 262], [266, 266], [293, 293], [304, 305], [314, 314], [357, 357], [368, 368], [377, 377], [387, 388], [412, 412], [421, 421], [433, 433], [436, 436], [448, 448], [453, 453], [460, 460], [516, 516], [564, 564], [566, 567], [579, 580], [582, 583], [604, 604], [608, 608], [615, 615], [669, 669], [710, 710], [738, 738], [743, 743], [834, 834], [862, 863], [870, 871], [1023, 1023], [1105, 1105], [1115, 1115], [1120, 1120], [1124, 1124], [1131, 1131], [1137, 1137], [1145, 1145], [1182, 1182], [1194, 1194], [1196, 1196], [1207, 1207], [1210, 1210], [1215, 1215], [1218, 1218], [1223, 1223], [1227, 1227], [1233, 1233], [1239, 1239], [1246, 1246], [1248, 1248], [1254, 1254], [1259, 1259], [1267, 1267], [1271, 1271], [1277, 1277], [1281, 1281], [1288, 1288], [1309, 1309], [1326, 1326], [1331, 1331], [1346, 1346], [1357, 1357], [1367, 1367], [1393, 1393], [1396, 1396], [1431, 1432], [1436, 1436], [1446, 1446], [1456, 1456], [1460, 1460], [1468, 1468], [1471, 1472], [1482, 1482], [1488, 1488], [1492, 1492], [1512, 1512], [1516, 1516], [1525, 1525], [1532, 1532], [1542, 1542], [1548, 1548], [1558, 1558], [1570, 1570], [1582, 1582], [1588, 1588], [1604, 1604], [1630, 1630], [1637, 1637], [1649, 1649]], [[3, 13], [21, 22], [86, 87]], [[55, 56], [71, 71], [128, 128], [138, 138], [316, 316], [462, 462], [617, 617], [981, 981], [1013, 1013], [1018, 1019], [1090, 1090], [1101, 1101], [1112, 1112], [1127, 1127], [1134, 1134], [1141, 1141], [1147, 1147], [1179, 1180], [1189, 1189], [1298, 1298], [1316, 1316], [1323, 1323], [1351, 1351], [1376, 1376], [1403, 1403], [1417, 1417], [1567, 1567], [1579, 1579]], [[38, 39], [99, 100], [155, 156], [395, 396], [697, 698], [714, 715], [740, 740], [776, 777]], [[164, 165], [184, 185], [334, 336], [407, 408], [559, 560], [705, 706], [828, 829], [843, 844]], [[212, 213], [217, 217]], [[246, 247], [258, 259]], [[179, 180], [275, 276]], [[321, 322], [325, 325], [332, 332], [349, 349], [353, 353]], [[319, 319], [330, 330], [465, 465], [620, 620], [1027, 1027], [1042, 1042], [1078, 1078], [1158, 1158], [1169, 1169]], [[287, 290], [342, 345], [482, 485], [637, 640], [751, 754], [757, 757], [767, 770], [889, 892], [902, 902], [912, 912]], [[399, 400], [416, 417], [441, 442], [500, 501], [531, 532]], [[219, 220], [426, 427]], [[467, 468], [471, 471], [490, 490], [495, 495]], [[349, 350], [490, 491], [644, 645]], [[551, 552], [571, 572], [589, 589], [653, 654], [682, 683], [687, 687]], [[564, 567], [579, 586], [595, 595], [721, 722], [727, 727], [795, 795]], [[622, 623], [626, 626], [644, 644], [648, 648], [743, 745], [862, 864], [884, 884], [895, 895]], [[508, 508], [661, 661]], [[547, 548], [693, 694], [797, 799], [807, 807], [814, 814], [820, 820], [824, 824], [830, 830], [840, 840], [855, 855], [916, 916], [964, 964], [967, 967]], [[847, 847], [936, 936], [985, 988]], [[938, 939], [955, 955]], [[959, 959], [975, 975], [1534, 1534]], [[1033, 1034], [1037, 1037], [1045, 1045], [1066, 1066]], [[1054, 1063], [1070, 1070]], [[1165, 1165], [1185, 1185]], [[1197, 1199], [1202, 1202], [1248, 1251]], [[1162, 1163], [1204, 1205], [1213, 1214]], [[1166, 1167], [1292, 1293], [1371, 1372]], [[1381, 1387], [1390, 1390]], [[1545, 1550], [1553, 1553]], [[1449, 1450], [1621, 1622]], [[1615, 1616], [1623, 1623]], [[1610, 1611], [1627, 1627]]]"
34,THE MISER IN THE BUSH,"A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley. As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man. ‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way. Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’ said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master! master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’ ‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain. Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried. The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows. So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift. Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins. Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.","A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for A farmer three years, without having been paid any wages.

Then the judge called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell judge, clerks, and jailer now, the miser, where the miser got that gold, or the judge shall play on for the miser's amusement only,’ ‘the miser stole that gold,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘the miser acknowledge that the miser stole that gold, and that the judge earned that gold fairly.’ Then A farmer stopped a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it, and left the miser to take the miser's place at the gallows.","[[[0, 1], [14, 14], [30, 32], [35, 35], [47, 47], [50, 50], [50, 51], [57, 57], [62, 62], [67, 67], [71, 71], [74, 74], [76, 76], [81, 81], [85, 86], [95, 95], [95, 96], [104, 104], [111, 111], [120, 122], [137, 137], [142, 142], [155, 155], [166, 166], [172, 172], [174, 174], [177, 177], [191, 191], [206, 206], [210, 210], [213, 213], [223, 223], [230, 230], [233, 233], [245, 245], [249, 249], [253, 253], [264, 264], [288, 289], [294, 294], [303, 304], [314, 315], [323, 323], [336, 336], [347, 347], [359, 359], [364, 365], [368, 368], [376, 376], [386, 386], [396, 396], [411, 411], [419, 419], [427, 427], [434, 434], [437, 437], [444, 444], [452, 452], [548, 549], [552, 552], [561, 561], [564, 564], [601, 602], [605, 605], [708, 709], [721, 721], [750, 752], [759, 759], [761, 761], [803, 804], [810, 810], [814, 814], [823, 823], [830, 830], [839, 839], [872, 874], [907, 911], [916, 916], [923, 923], [980, 980], [990, 991], [1060, 1060], [1063, 1063], [1067, 1067], [1073, 1073], [1076, 1076], [1104, 1104], [1110, 1110], [1125, 1125], [1173, 1174], [1176, 1176], [1303, 1303], [1309, 1309], [1326, 1326], [1327, 1327], [1334, 1334], [1408, 1409], [1411, 1411]], [[117, 118], [124, 124], [174, 175]], [[253, 257], [260, 261], [297, 297]], [[177, 178], [264, 265], [789, 790], [825, 826]], [[202, 204], [278, 280], [317, 317], [321, 321], [327, 329], [344, 344], [431, 432], [442, 442], [1146, 1148]], [[292, 292], [299, 299], [307, 307]], [[402, 414], [414, 414], [605, 606], [682, 683], [830, 831], [1076, 1077], [1176, 1177], [1411, 1412]], [[348, 349], [437, 439]], [[455, 457], [460, 460], [466, 466], [471, 471], [479, 479], [485, 485]], [[521, 522], [525, 525], [582, 583], [594, 594], [601, 601], [612, 613], [635, 635], [644, 644], [647, 648], [672, 673], [688, 688], [696, 696], [712, 712], [716, 716], [728, 729], [740, 740], [744, 744], [768, 769], [778, 778], [786, 786], [789, 789], [818, 818], [843, 844], [864, 864], [867, 867], [872, 872], [880, 880], [893, 893], [895, 895], [900, 900], [936, 937], [942, 942], [945, 945], [956, 957], [961, 961], [966, 966], [971, 971], [977, 977], [986, 986], [997, 997], [1010, 1010], [1018, 1018], [1024, 1024], [1029, 1029], [1033, 1033], [1038, 1038], [1047, 1047], [1084, 1085], [1153, 1154], [1159, 1159], [1163, 1163], [1209, 1210], [1219, 1220], [1251, 1251], [1343, 1344], [1354, 1355], [1358, 1358], [1369, 1369], [1375, 1375], [1381, 1382], [1392, 1392], [1395, 1395], [1416, 1417], [1420, 1420]], [[504, 505], [556, 556], [570, 571], [590, 590]], [[495, 496], [579, 580]], [[573, 580], [586, 587], [848, 849]], [[635, 636], [638, 639]], [[780, 800], [806, 808], [1335, 1337]], [[883, 884], [927, 928], [931, 931], [994, 995], [1033, 1035], [1052, 1053], [1114, 1115], [1136, 1136], [1246, 1246], [1321, 1322], [1340, 1340], [1364, 1364], [1401, 1401]], [[931, 932], [939, 939]], [[971, 972], [979, 979]], [[978, 978], [998, 998]], [[1047, 1048], [1067, 1068], [1327, 1328]], [[818, 819], [1140, 1141]], [[1190, 1195], [1200, 1200], [1241, 1241], [1295, 1295], [1317, 1317], [1351, 1351]], [[1216, 1217], [1219, 1219], [1231, 1231]], [[1182, 1183], [1238, 1239]], [[1266, 1267], [1276, 1276]], [[1360, 1361], [1377, 1377], [1397, 1397], [1403, 1403]], [[1013, 1014], [1423, 1424]]]"
35,ASHPUTTEL,"The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her; they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her into the kitchen. There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel. It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for. Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’ Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast too.’ Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!   Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,   Hither, hither, haste away!   One and all come help me, quick!   Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’ Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes. And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite done, and all flew out again at the windows. Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes. But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before:  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!   Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,   Hither, hither, haste away!   One and all come help me, quick!   Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’ Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball. But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off she went with her two daughters to the ball. Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,   Gold and silver over me!’ Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her, and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel, taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt. The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’ Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her little grey frock. The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,   Gold and silver over me!’ And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’ When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey frock. The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she went again into the garden, and said:  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,   Gold and silver over me!’ Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’ When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however, she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs. The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father, and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe, and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards. But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:  ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!   The shoe is too small, and not made for you!   Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,   For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’ Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home, and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her. But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still, and sang:  ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!   The shoe is too small, and not made for you!   Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,   For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’ Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot, and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:  ‘Home! home! look at the shoe!   Princess! the shoe was made for you!   Prince! prince! take home thy bride,   For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’ And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon her right shoulder, and so went home with her.","The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when The wife of a rich man felt that The wife of a rich man's end drew nigh, The wife of a rich man called The wife of a rich man only daughter to The wife of a rich man's bed-side, and said, ‘Always be a good girl, and The wife of a rich man will look down from heaven and watch over her only daughter.’ Soon afterwards The wife of a rich man shut The wife of a rich man's eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and her only daughter went every day to The wife of a rich man's grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her only daughter. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful white covering over her grave; but by the time the spring came, and the sun had melted a beautiful white covering away again, a rich man had married another wife. another wife had two daughters of another wife's own, that another wife brought home with another wife; two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for her only daughter. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the parlour?’ said two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn bread; away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her took away her only daughter's fine clothes, and gave her only daughter an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her only daughter, and turned her only daughter into the kitchen. There her only daughter was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that, two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her plagued her only daughter in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her only daughter. In the evening when her only daughter was tired, her only daughter had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as lie, of course, made her only daughter always dusty and dirty, two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her called her only daughter Ashputtel. It happened once that a rich man was going to the fair, and asked a rich man's daughters what a rich man should bring his wife’s daughters. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, her only daughter,’ said a rich man to a rich man's , ‘what will her only daughter have?’ ‘The first twig, a rich man, that brushes against a rich man's hat when a rich man turn a rich man's face to come homewards,’ said her only daughter. Then a rich man bought for his wife’s daughters the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds his wife’s daughters had asked for: and on a rich man's way home, as a rich man rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against a rich man, and almost pushed off your hat: so a rich man broke your hat off and brought your hat away; and when a rich man got home a rich man gave your hat to a rich man's . Then her only daughter took your hat, and went to her only daughter's grave and planted your hat there; and cried so much that your hat was watered with her only daughter's tears; and there your hat grew and became a fine tree. Three times every day her only daughter went to a fine tree and cried; and soon a little bird came and built a little bird's nest upon a fine tree, and talked with her only daughter, and watched over her only daughter, and brought her only daughter whatever her only daughter wished for. Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to last three days; and out of those who came to a feast, which was to last three days the king of that land's son was to choose a bride for his son. her only daughter's two sisters were asked to come; so Ashputtel’s two sisters called her only daughter up, and said, ‘Now, comb Ashputtel’s two sisters's hair, brush Ashputtel’s two sisters's shoes, and tie Ashputtel’s two sisters's sashes for Ashputtel’s two sisters, for Ashputtel’s two sisters are going to dance at the king of that land's .’ Then her only daughter did as her only daughter was told; but when all was done her only daughter could not help crying, for her only daughter thought to her only daughter, her only daughter should so have liked to have gone with Ashputtel’s two sisters to the ball; and at last her only daughter begged her only daughter's very hard to let her only daughter go. ‘The wife of a rich man, The wife of a rich man!’ said her only daughter; ‘you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--The wife of a rich man want to go to the ball? And when her only daughter kept on begging, her only daughter said at last, to get rid of her only daughter, ‘her only daughter will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours’ time her only daughter have picked peas out, her only daughter shall go to a feast, which was to last three days too.’ Then her only daughter threw this dishful of peas down among the ashes, but her only daughter ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!   Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,   Hither, hither, haste away!   One and all come help her only daughter, quick!   Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’ Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after two turtle-doves came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in flew down into the ashes. And two turtle-doves stooped two turtle-doves's heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in soon picked out all the good grain, and put all the good grain into a dish but left the ashes.

Then her only daughter brought a dish to her only daughter's , overjoyed at the thought that now her only daughter should go to the ball. But The wife of a rich man said, ‘No, no! her only daughter, her only daughter have no clothes, and cannot dance; her only daughter shall not go.’ And when her only daughter begged very hard to go, The wife of a rich man said, ‘If her only daughter can in one hour’s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, her only daughter shall go too.’ And thus The wife of a rich man thought The wife of a rich man should at least get rid of her only daughter. So her only daughter shook two of those dishes of peas into the ashes. But her only daughter went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before:  ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,   Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!

And all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about flew down into the ashes; and two turtle-doves put two turtle-doves's heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about put all the good grain into two of those dishes of peas, and left the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all was done, and out all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about flew again. And then her only daughter took two of those dishes of peas to her only daughter's , rejoicing to think that her only daughter should now go to the ball. But her only daughter's said, ‘It is all of no use, her only daughter cannot go; her only daughter have no clothes, and cannot dance, and her only daughter would only put us to shame’: and off The wife of a rich man went with The wife of a rich man's two daughters to the ball. Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, her only daughter went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:  ‘Shake, shake, the hazel-tree,   Gold and silver over her only daughter!’ Then her only daughter's friend the bird flew out of the hazel-tree, and brought a gold and silver dress for her only daughter, and slippers of spangled silk; and her only daughter put a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk on, and followed two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her to a feast, which was to last three days. But two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her did not know her only daughter, and thought it must be some strange princess, her only daughter looked so fine and beautiful in her only daughter's rich clothes; and two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her never once thought of her only daughter, taking it for granted that her only daughter was safe at home in the dirt. his son soon came up to her only daughter, and took her only daughter by the hand and danced with her only daughter, and no one else: and his son never left the hand; but when anyone else came to ask her only daughter to dance, his son said, ‘her only daughter is dancing with his son.’ Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then her only daughter wanted to go home: and his son said, ‘his son shall go and take care of her only daughter to her only daughter's home’; for his son wanted to see where her only daughter lived. But her only daughter slipped away from his son, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as his son followed her only daughter, her only daughter jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the door. Then his son waited till a rich man came home, and told a rich man that her only daughtera feast, which was to last three days, had hid her only daughter in the pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the house, her only daughter was lying, as her only daughter always did, in her only daughter's dirty frock by the ashes, and her only daughter's dim little lamp was burning in the chimney. For her only daughter had run as quickly as her only daughter could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her fine clothes, and put her fine clothes beneath the hazel-tree, that the bird might carry her fine clothes away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her dirty frock. The next day when a feast, which was to last three days was again held, and her only daughter's father, mother, and sisters were gone, her only daughter went to the hazel-tree, and said:  ‘Shake, shake, the hazel-tree,   Gold and silver over her only daughter!’ And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one her only daughter had worn the day before. And when her only daughter came in a still finer dress than the one she had worn the day before to the ball, everyone wondered at her only daughter's beauty: but his son, took her only daughter by the hand, and danced with her only daughter; and when anyone asked her only daughter to dance, his son said as before, ‘her only daughter is dancing with his son.’ When night came her only daughter wanted to go home; and his son followed here as before, that his son might see into what house her only daughter went: but her only daughter sprang away from his son all at once into the gardenthe house. In the garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and her only daughter, not knowing where to hide her only daughter, jumped up into a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit without being seen. Then his son lost sight of her only daughter, and could not find out where her only daughter was gone, but waited till a rich man came home, and said to a rich man, ‘her only daughter a rich man has slipped away, and a rich man think her only daughter must have sprung into a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit.’ a rich man thought to a rich man, ‘Can it be her only daughter?’ So a rich man had an axe brought; and they cut down a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit, but found no one upon a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit. And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay her only daughter among the ashes; for her only daughter had slipped down on the other side of a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit, and carried her fine clothes back to the bird, and then put on her dirty frock. The third day, when her father, mother, and sisters were gone, her only daughter went again into the garden, and said:  ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,   Gold and silver over her only daughter!’ Then the bird brought a dress still finer than her dirty frock, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when her only daughter came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her only daughter's beauty: and his son danced with nobody but her only daughter; and when anyone else asked her only daughter to dance, his son said, ‘her only daughter is _his son's_ partner, sir.’ When night came her only daughter wanted to go home; and his son would go with her only daughter, and said to his son, ‘his son will not lose her only daughter this time’; but, however, her only daughter again slipped away from his son, though in such a hurry that her only daughter dropped her only daughter left golden slipper upon the stairs. his son took her left golden slipper, and went the next day to a rich manhis son's , and said, ‘his son will take for his son's wife her only daughter that her left golden slipper fits.’ Then two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her were overjoyed to hear it; for two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her could wear her left golden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where her left golden slipper was, and wanted to try her left golden slipper on, and The wife of a rich man stood by. But her only daughter's great toe could not go into her left golden slipper, and her left golden slipper was altogether much too small for her only daughter. Then The wife of a rich man gave her only daughter a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut her great toe off; when her only daughter are queen her only daughter will not care about toes; her only daughter will not want to walk.’ So her only daughter cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on her left golden slipper, and went to his son. Then his son took her only daughter for his son's bride, and set her only daughter beside his son on his son's horse, and rode away with her only daughter's homewards. But on their way home their had to pass by the hazel-tree that her only daughter had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:  ‘Back again! back again! look to her left golden slipper!   her left golden slipper is too small, and not made for you!   Prince! prince! look again for his bride,   For his bride’s not the true one that sits by Prince! prince!'s side.’ Then his son got down and looked at her only daughter's foot; and his son saw, by the blood that streamed from her foot, what a trick her only daughter had played his son. So his son turned his horse round, and brought her only daughter back to her only daughter's home, and said, ‘her only daughter is not the right bride; let two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her try and put on her left golden slipper.’ Then her only daughter went into the room and got her only daughter's foot into her left golden slipper, all but the heel, which was too large. But her only daughter's squeezed her foot in till the blood came, and took her only daughter to his son: and his son set her only daughter as his son's bride by his son's side on his horse, and rode away with her only daughter. But when they came to the hazel-tree that Ashputtel had planted a little dove sat there still, and sang:  ‘Back again! back again! look to her left golden slipper!   her left golden slipper is too small, and not made for her only daughter!   Prince! prince! look again for his bride,   For his bride’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’ Then Prince! prince! looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from her left golden slipper, that her only daughter's white stockings were quite red. So Prince! prince! turned his horse and brought her only daughter also back again. ‘her only daughter is not the true bride,’ said Prince! prince! to a rich man; ‘have a rich man no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said a rich man; ‘there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of a rich man's ; a rich man am sure only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife cannot be the bride.’ his son told a rich man to send her only daughter. But The wife of a rich man said, ‘No, no, her only daughter is much too dirty; her only daughter will not dare to show her only daughter.’ However, his son would have her only daughter come; and her only daughter first washed her only daughter's face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to his son, and his son reached her only daughter her left golden slipper. Then her only daughter took her only daughter's clumsy shoe off her only daughter's left foot, and put on her left golden slipper; and her left golden slipper fitted her only daughter as if her left golden slipper had been made for her only daughter. And when his son drew near and looked at her only daughter's face his son knew her only daughter, and said, ‘her only daughter is the right bride.’ But The wife of a rich man and two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her were frightened, and turned pale with anger as his son took her only daughter on his horse, and rode away with her only daughter. And when they came to the hazel-tree, a little dove sang:  ‘Home! home! look at her clumsy shoe!   Princess! her clumsy shoe was made for her only daughter!   Prince! prince! take home his bride,   For his bride is the true one that sits by his son's side!’ And when a little dove had done a little dove's song, a little dove came flying, and perched upon her only daughter's right shoulder, and so went home with her only daughter.","[[[0, 5], [11, 11], [14, 14], [19, 19], [21, 21], [25, 25], [41, 41], [55, 55], [57, 57], [77, 77], [350, 352], [502, 504],

36,THE WHITE SNAKE,"A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone. This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals. Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was dismissed with no better answer. In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened. They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’ ‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her. The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you and repay you for saving us!’ He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’ The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’ But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves, and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’ And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor. So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea. He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward. But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be wanting.’ The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death. But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks. Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and said: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.","A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land's wisdom through all the land.

They cut a golden apple in two and ate a golden apple together; and then the queen's heart became full of love for a trusty servant, and They lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.","[[[6, 17], [12, 12], [23, 23], [39, 39], [45, 45], [75, 75], [104, 105], [116, 116], [320, 321], [329, 329], [609, 610], [1101, 1103], [1149, 1151], [1169, 1170], [1201, 1202], [1351, 1352], [1356, 1356], [1558, 1560], [1808, 1810]], [[76, 78], [80, 80], [96, 96], [114, 114], [139, 140], [153, 154], [180, 181]], [[69, 71], [87, 89], [133, 140], [148, 148], [156, 156], [160, 160], [167, 167], [185, 185], [188, 188], [192, 192], [200, 200], [210, 210], [218, 218], [221, 221], [230, 230], [233, 233], [275, 275], [309, 318], [323, 324], [338, 338], [348, 349], [349, 349], [361, 361], [363, 363], [366, 366], [375, 375], [379, 379], [391, 391], [394, 394], [433, 434], [502, 503], [599, 600], [605, 605], [620, 620], [628, 628], [636, 636], [641, 642], [659, 659], [674, 674], [678, 678], [682, 682], [694, 694], [718, 718], [732, 732], [738, 738], [741, 741], [766, 766], [772, 772], [775, 775], [781, 781], [792, 792], [794, 794], [802, 802], [805, 805], [852, 852], [867, 867], [873, 873], [885, 885], [892, 892], [1003, 1006], [1010, 1010], [1013, 1013], [1043, 1043], [1054, 1054], [1058, 1058], [1064, 1064], [1071, 1071], [1146, 1147], [1153, 1153], [1162, 1162], [1174, 1174], [1179, 1179], [1197, 1197], [1204, 1204], [1222, 1222], [1228, 1228], [1237, 1237], [1249, 1251], [1259, 1259], [1265, 1265], [1273, 1273], [1279, 1279], [1286, 1286], [1296, 1296], [1319, 1321], [1326, 1326], [1347, 1347], [1359, 1359], [1371, 1371], [1381, 1381], [1385, 1385], [1438, 1439], [1458, 1458], [1466, 1466], [1476, 1476], [1497, 1497], [1575, 1577], [1585, 1585], [1602, 1602], [1609, 1609], [1616, 1616], [1629, 1630], [1642, 1642], [1657, 1657], [1661, 1661], [1664, 1664], [1673, 1673], [1680, 1680], [1698, 1698], [1712, 1712], [1724, 1724], [1729, 1729], [1743, 1743], [1757, 1757], [1786, 1786], [1791, 1792], [1846, 1846]], [[109, 110], [170, 171]], [[175, 177], [187, 187], [197, 197], [271, 272]], [[203, 205], [208, 208], [216, 216]], [[244, 245], [261, 261]], [[293, 294], [296, 296], [496, 498], [507, 507], [513, 513], [534, 534], [547, 547], [553, 553], [560, 560], [577, 577], [582, 582], [590, 592], [597, 597], [1101, 1104], [1112, 1112], [1149, 1152], [1158, 1158], [1366, 1368], [1374, 1374], [1379, 1379], [1392, 1392], [1401, 1401], [1415, 1415], [1558, 1562], [1562, 1562], [1582, 1582], [1588, 1588], [1593, 1593], [1613, 1613], [1619, 1619], [1808, 1822], [1839, 1839]], [[296, 299], [306, 306]], [[375, 378], [394, 395]], [[398, 399], [409, 409], [415, 415], [418, 418], [422, 422], [425, 425], [440, 440], [450, 450], [463, 463]], [[468, 468], [480, 480], [484, 484], [489, 489]], [[521, 522], [542, 543], [549, 549], [574, 574]], [[648, 648], [674, 675]], [[696, 705], [720, 720], [723, 723], [745, 747], [753, 753], [760, 760], [769, 769], [778, 778]], [[650, 651], [741, 742], [1010, 1011], [1018, 1018], [1030, 1030]], [[820, 820], [823, 823]], [[820, 825], [829, 829]], [[832, 839], [837, 837]], [[810, 813], [845, 845], [860, 863], [870, 870], [1519, 1522]], [[856, 858], [882, 883]], [[894, 896], [899, 899], [905, 905], [926, 926], [929, 929]], [[905, 907], [912, 912], [914, 922], [935, 935], [939, 939], [948, 948], [952, 955], [962, 962], [974, 974], [977, 977], [981, 981], [985, 985], [992, 992], [1020, 1020], [1025, 1025], [1033, 1033], [1040, 1040]], [[1122, 1122], [1126, 1126], [1129, 1129]], [[1184, 1185], [1194, 1194], [1214, 1215], [1262, 1263], [1767, 1768]], [[1188, 1190], [1207, 1208], [1227, 1227], [1337, 1339], [1349, 1349]], [[1244, 1246], [1254, 1254]], [[1281, 1282], [1289, 1289]], [[1300, 1304], [1309, 1309], [1313, 1313]], [[1268, 1269], [1316, 1317]], [[802, 803], [1319, 1322]], [[1306, 1307], [1329, 1329], [1333, 1333]], [[1404, 1409], [1423, 1423], [1499, 1502], [1554, 1555]], [[1396, 1397], [1443, 1444], [1495, 1496], [1566, 1567]], [[1389, 1390], [1454, 1455]], [[1529, 1533], [1536, 1538]], [[1545, 1549], [1552, 1552]], [[1623, 1626], [1635, 1638], [1670, 1670], [1777, 1780]], [[1719, 1720], [1727, 1727], [1736, 1736], [1749, 1749], [1764, 1764]], [[1707, 1709], [1760, 1762], [1787, 1788], [1804, 1806], [1826, 1829], [1834, 1834]], [[1824, 1824], [1849, 1849]]]"
37,THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS,"There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind. It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: ‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind. So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children. At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her. When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah, heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred. When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he:  ‘What rumbles and tumbles   Against my poor bones?   I thought ‘twas six kids,   But it feels like big stones.’ And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.","There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved seven little kids with all the love of a mother for a mother's children. One day an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children called seven little kids to an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children and said: ‘seven little kids, an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children have to go into the forest, be on seven little kids's guard against the wolf; if the wolf comes in, the wolf will devour seven little kids all--skin, hair, and everything. the wolf often disguises the wolf, but seven little kids will know the wolf at once by the wolf's rough voice and the wolf's black feet.’ seven little kids said: ‘an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children, seven little kids will take good care of seven little kids; an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children may go away without any anxiety.’ Then an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children bleated, and went on an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children's way with an easy mind. It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: ‘Open the house-door, seven little kids; seven little kids's mother is here, and has brought something back with your mother for each of seven little kids.’ But seven little kids knew that someone was the wolf, by his rough voice. ‘seven little kids will not open the house-door,’ cried seven little kids, ‘someone are not your mother. your mother has a soft, pleasant voice, but his rough voice is rough; someone are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought the wolf a great lump of chalk, ate a great lump of chalk and made his rough voice soft with a great lump of chalk.

When seven little kids saw drowned, seven little kids came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘the wolf is dead! the wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about a well with your mother.","[[[11, 13], [17, 17], [46, 47], [54, 55], [67, 67], [81, 81], [98, 98], [114, 115], [122, 122], [128, 128], [175, 176], [178, 178], [193, 193], [197, 199], [213, 213], [222, 222], [228, 228], [299, 300], [302, 302], [316, 316], [332, 333], [340, 340], [347, 347], [532, 534], [540, 540], [544, 544], [550, 550], [567, 568], [575, 575], [598, 598], [605, 605], [658, 659], [673, 673], [789, 790], [793, 793], [802, 802], [860, 862], [872, 874], [950, 960], [1019, 1020], [1048, 1048], [1057, 1057], [1059, 1059], [1108, 1110], [1129, 1129], [1243, 1244], [1284, 1286], [1290, 1290], [1321, 1321]], [[23, 24], [26, 26]], [[6, 27], [31, 31], [44, 44], [49, 49], [57, 57], [119, 120], [130, 130], [140, 142], [148, 148], [998, 998], [1014, 1014]], [[36, 37], [62, 63], [526, 527], [736, 737]], [[70, 71], [74, 74], [78, 78], [91, 92], [95, 95], [101, 101], [105, 105], [109, 109], [204, 205], [247, 248], [252, 253], [261, 261], [272, 272], [279, 279], [320, 321], [324, 324], [358, 359], [363, 364], [373, 373], [376, 376], [385, 385], [398, 398], [412, 412], [415, 415], [425, 426], [437, 438], [449, 449], [467, 467], [480, 481], [504, 504], [541, 541], [557, 557], [559, 559], [579, 579], [595, 596], [655, 656], [671, 671], [675, 675], [693, 693], [699, 700], [703, 703], [705, 705], [707, 707], [711, 711], [853, 854], [902, 903], [919, 919], [932, 932], [954, 954], [959, 959], [990, 992], [1042, 1042], [1044, 1045], [1093, 1096], [1101, 1101], [1138, 1138], [1148, 1148], [1160, 1161], [1166, 1166], [1171, 1171], [1174, 1174], [1182, 1182], [1185, 1185], [1189, 1189], [1201, 1201], [1213, 1213], [1224, 1224], [1234, 1234], [1239, 1239], [1257, 1257], [1274, 1274], [1279, 1279], [1301, 1302], [1306, 1307]], [[163, 166], [172, 173], [217, 218], [285, 289], [296, 297], [344, 345], [488, 491], [495, 495], [501, 502], [586, 587], [748, 751]], [[178, 179], [189, 189], [228, 229], [231, 231], [302, 303], [312, 312], [347, 348], [508, 511], [529, 529], [548, 548], [550, 553], [729, 731], [744, 744], [787, 787], [789, 789], [800, 800], [818, 818], [830, 831], [842, 842], [851, 851], [869, 869], [872, 872], [879, 879], [881, 881], [891, 891], [916, 916], [942, 942], [950, 950], [986, 987], [1059, 1061], [1072, 1073], [1135, 1136], [1321, 1322]], [[160, 160], [202, 202], [225, 225], [240, 240], [245, 245], [354, 354], [356, 356]], [[105, 107], [208, 210], [240, 241], [272, 273]], [[262, 266], [269, 269], [276, 276]], [[324, 326], [335, 335], [541, 542], [559, 560], [571, 571]], [[109, 111], [376, 377], [383, 383], [394, 395], [412, 413]], [[367, 368], [390, 391], [394, 394]], [[401, 402], [418, 419], [422, 422], [443, 443], [452, 452], [456, 457], [463, 463]], [[407, 407], [447, 447]], [[506, 506], [508, 508], [522, 522]], [[328, 329], [563, 564]], [[646, 647], [678, 687], [821, 822], [833, 833], [844, 845], [849, 849], [886, 888], [969, 970]], [[649, 652], [684, 687], [836, 839]], [[640, 643], [767, 770]], [[717, 720], [897, 898]], [[932, 934], [990, 993], [1093, 1097], [1126, 1127], [1182, 1183], [1213, 1214]], [[1004, 1006], [1008, 1008]], [[1066, 1070], [1069, 1069]], [[1085, 1087], [1099, 1099], [1112, 1113], [1124, 1124], [1179, 1183], [1210, 1214], [1270, 1272]], [[1194, 1195], [1260, 1261], [1318, 1319]], [[1280, 1280], [1288, 1288]]]"
38,THE QUEEN BEE,"Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not suffer you to trouble them.’ So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey. But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’ At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then he rose and came out to them. He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber. The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table, where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun, he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’ The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day: but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was turned into stone as the tablet had foretold. The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone. At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a heap. The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it, he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom. The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey; so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey. Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.","Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek Two kings’ sons's fortunes; but Two kings’ sons soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so that Two kings’ sons could not return home again.

39,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes. Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening. He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece. The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more. In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and the good man soon became thriving and well off again. One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up there, and watched what would happen. As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as lightning. The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’ The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do. About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted. Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green. The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.","There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes. Then a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest cut just leather enough to make one pair of shoes out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning to rise early in the morning to a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's work. a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's conscience was clear and a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's heart light amidst all a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's troubles; so a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest went peaceably to bed, left all a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest had said a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's prayers, a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest sat a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest down to his work; when, to a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's great wonder, there stood one pair of shoes, upon the table. a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening. a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that the whole job was quite a masterpiece. The same day a customer came in, and one pair of shoes suited a customer so well that a customer willingly paid a price higher than usual for one pair of shoes; and a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest, with a price higher than usual, bought leather enough to make two pairs more. In the evening a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest cut out the work, and went to bed early, that a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest might get up and begin betimes the next day; but a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest was saved all the trouble, for when a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest got up in the morning the work was done ready to a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest handsomely for a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's goods, so that a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest bought leather enough for four pair more. a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest cut out the work again overnight and found the work done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest soon became thriving and well off again. One evening, about Christmas-time, as a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest and a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's wife were sitting over the fire chatting together, a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest said to his wife, ‘a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest should like to sit up and watch tonight, that he and his wife may see who it is that comes and does a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's work for a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest.’ his wife liked the thought; so he and his wife left a light burning, and hid he and his wife in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up there, and watched what would happen. As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and two little naked dwarfs sat two little naked dwarfs upon a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with two little naked dwarfs's little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest was all wonder, and could not take a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest's eyes off two little naked dwarfs. And on two little naked dwarfs went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then two little naked dwarfs bustled away as quick as lightning. The next day his wife said to a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest. ‘two little naked dwarfs have made us rich, and us ought to be thankful to two little naked dwarfs, and do two little naked dwarfs a good turn if us can. his wife am quite sorry to see two little naked dwarfs run about as two little naked dwarfs do; and indeed it is not very decent, for two little naked dwarfs have nothing upon two little naked dwarfs's backs to keep off the cold. his wife’ll tell a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest what, his wife will make each of two little naked dwarfs a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest make each of two little naked dwarfs a little pair of shoes.’ The thought pleased a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, he and his wife laid all the things on the table, instead of the work that he and his wife used to cut out, and then went and hid he and his wife, to watch what two little naked dwarfs would do. About midnight in two little naked dwarfs came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to two little naked dwarfs's work as usual; but when two little naked dwarfs saw all the things lying for two little naked dwarfs, two little naked dwarfs laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted. Then two little naked dwarfs dressed two little naked dwarfs in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last two little naked dwarfs danced out at the door, and away over the green. he and his wife saw two little naked dwarfs no more; but everything went well with he and his wife from that time forward, as long as he and his wife lived.","[[[3, 13], [17, 17], [30, 30], [50, 50], [52, 52], [73, 73], [76, 76], [81, 81], [86, 86], [90, 90], [98, 98], [112, 112], [115, 115], [118, 118], [120, 120], [123, 123], [129, 129], [145, 147], [162, 162], [221, 223], [241, 241], [254, 254], [265, 265], [274, 274], [286, 286], [296, 296], [299, 299], [304, 304], [313, 313], [354, 356], [374, 374], [376, 376], [386, 386], [392, 392], [413, 413], [416, 416], [477, 479], [513, 514], [523, 523], [574, 575], [642, 642], [671, 671], [686, 688]], [[39, 47], [52, 53]], [[73, 74], [123, 124]], [[44, 47], [135, 139], [202, 203], [218, 218]], [[175, 177], [187, 187]], [[196, 197], [205, 205], [209, 209]], [[212, 216], [226, 227]], [[61, 63], [261, 262]], [[244, 245], [316, 317], [322, 322]], [[376, 377], [389, 389], [419, 420], [570, 571], [605, 605], [639, 639], [645, 645]], [[374, 377], [403, 403], [426, 426], [434, 434], [703, 703], [715, 715], [726, 726], [825, 827], [838, 838], [847, 847]], [[467, 470], [473, 473], [475, 475], [497, 497], [526, 526], [530, 530], [559, 559], [578, 580], [593, 593], [597, 597], [611, 611], [615, 615], [627, 627], [631, 631], [650, 650], [675, 675], [731, 733], [740, 740], [759, 759], [766, 766], [772, 772], [774, 774], [785, 785], [787, 787], [812, 812], [829, 829]], [[142, 143], [548, 549], [707, 708]], [[583, 583], [587, 587], [602, 602]], [[697, 699], [705, 705], [768, 769]]]"
40,THE JUNIPER-TREE,"Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they remained childless. In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree. One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed, and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy was so great that she died. Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he married again. He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time he went back. One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock. ‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he comes out of school.’ Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a wicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head. Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done. ‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand. Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale; and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that frightened me.’ ‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran crying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her. ‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it, so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt. Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked, ‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing. The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’ ‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’ ‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’ ‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six weeks; he is well looked after there.’ ‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’ With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table. Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the bones were gone. Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate. The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to sing:  ‘My mother killed her little son;   My father grieved when I was gone;   My sister loved me best of all;   She laid her kerchief over me,   And took my bones that they might lie   Underneath the juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street. ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’ ‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold chain, and I will sing it you again.’ ‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that again.’ The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:  ‘My mother killed her little son;   My father grieved when I was gone;   My sister loved me best of all;   She laid her kerchief over me,   And took my bones that they might lie   Underneath the juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and sang:  ‘My mother killed her little son;   My father grieved when I was gone;   My sister loved me best of all;   She laid her kerchief over me,   And took my bones that they might lie   Underneath the juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun. ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head. ‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’ ‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must give me something.’ ‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched the shoes. ‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’ The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he went back to the roof and sang:  ‘My mother killed her little son;   My father grieved when I was gone;   My sister loved me best of all;   She laid her kerchief over me,   And took my bones that they might lie   Underneath the juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack, hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:  ‘My mother killed her little son; then one of the men left off,   My father grieved when I was gone; two more men left off and listened,   My sister loved me best of all; then four more left off,   She laid her kerchief over me,   And took my bones that they might lie now there were only eight at work,   Underneath And now only five,   the juniper-tree. And now only one,   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ then he looked up and the last one had left off work. ‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it too; sing it again.’ ‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that millstone, and I will sing it again.’ ‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’ The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the tree and sang--  ‘My mother killed her little son;   My father grieved when I was gone;   My sister loved me best of all;   She laid her kerchief over me,   And took my bones that they might lie   Underneath the juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house. The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner. ‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’ ‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm were coming.’ But little Marleen sat and wept and wept. Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof. ‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’ ‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears. The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:  ‘My mother killed her little son; the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:   My father grieved when I was gone; ‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!’   My sister loved me best of all; then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed. ‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man. ‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in flames!’ But the man went out and looked at the bird.  She laid her kerchief over me,  And took my bones that they might lie  Underneath the juniper-tree  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly. He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’ But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor, and her cap fell from her head. Then the bird began again:  ‘My mother killed her little son; ‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the earth, that I might not hear that song.’   My father grieved when I was gone; then the woman fell down again as if dead.   My sister loved me best of all; ‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will give me anything.’ So she went out.   She laid her kerchief over me,   And took my bones that they might lie and he threw down the shoes to her,   Underneath the juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’ And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’ The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’ But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone down on her head, and she was crushed to death. The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.","Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich man with a good and beautiful wife. a rich man with a good and beautiful wife loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that a rich man with a good and beautiful wife had no children. So greatly did a rich man with a good and beautiful wife desire to have one, that a good and beautiful wife prayed for one day and night, but still a rich man with a good and beautiful wife remained childless. In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree. One winter’s day a good and beautiful wife stood under a juniper-tree to peel some apples, and as a good and beautiful wife was peeling some apples, a good and beautiful wife cut a good and beautiful wife's finger, and the blood fell on the snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed a good and beautiful wife heavily, ‘if a good and beautiful wife had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow,’ and as a good and beautiful wife spoke the words, a good and beautiful wife's heart grew light within a good and beautiful wife, and it seemed to a good and beautiful wife that had was granted, and a good and beautiful wife returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed, and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all the earth was green.

A little while later a good and beautiful wife called a rich man, and said to a rich man, weeping. ‘If a good and beautiful wife die, bury a good and beautiful wife under a juniper-tree.’ Then a good and beautiful wife felt comforted and happy again, and before another month had passed a good and beautiful wife had a little child, and when a good and beautiful wife saw that a little child was as white as snow and as red as blood, a good and beautiful wife's joy was so great that a good and beautiful wife died. a rich man buried a good and beautiful wife under a juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for a good and beautiful wife. By degrees, however, a rich man's sorrow grew less, and although at times a rich man still grieved over a rich man's loss, a rich man was able to go about as usual, and later on a rich man married again. a rich man now had a little daughter born to a rich man; the child of a rich man's was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. a good and beautiful wife loved a good and beautiful wife very much, and when a good and beautiful wife looked at a good and beautiful wife and then looked at a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow, it pierced a good and beautiful wife's heart to think that a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow would always stand in the way of a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow, and a good and beautiful wife was continually thinking how a good and beautiful wife could get the whole of the property for a good and beautiful wife. This evil thought took possession of a good and beautiful wife more and more, and made a good and beautiful wife behave very unkindly to a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. a good and beautiful wife drove a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow went about in fear, and had no peace from the time a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow left school to the time a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow went back. One day a good and beautiful wife came running to a good and beautiful wife in the store-room, and said, ‘a good and beautiful wife, give a good and beautiful wife an apple.’ ‘Yes, a good and beautiful wife,’ said a good and beautiful wife, and a good and beautiful wife gave a good and beautiful wife a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock. ‘a good and beautiful wife,’ said a good and beautiful wife again, ‘may not a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow have one too?’ a good and beautiful wife was angry at this, but a good and beautiful wife answered, ‘Yes, when a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow comes out of school.’ Just then a good and beautiful wife looked out of the window and saw a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow coming, and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into a good and beautiful wife, for a good and beautiful wife snatched a beautiful apple out of a good and beautiful wife's hand, and said, ‘a good and beautiful wife shall not have one before a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow.’ a good and beautiful wife threw a beautiful apple into the chest and shut the chest to. a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow now came in, and an evil spirit made a good and beautiful wife say kindly to a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow, ‘a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow, will a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow have an apple?’ but a good and beautiful wife gave a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow a wicked look. ‘a good and beautiful wife,’ said a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow, ‘how dreadful a good and beautiful wife look! Yes, give a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow an apple.’ The thought came to a good and beautiful wife that a good and beautiful wife would kill a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. ‘Come with a good and beautiful wife,’ a good and beautiful wife said, and a good and beautiful wife lifted up a very heavy lid; ‘take one out for a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow.’ And as a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow bent over to do so, an evil spirit urged a good and beautiful wife, and crash! down went a very heavy lid, and off went a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow's head. Then a good and beautiful wife was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what a good and beautiful wife had done. ‘If only a good and beautiful wife can prevent anyone knowing that a good and beautiful wife did it,’ a good and beautiful wife thought. So a good and beautiful wife went upstairs to a good and beautiful wife's room, and took a white handkerchief out of a good and beautiful wife's top drawer; then a good and beautiful wife set the little boy’s head again on a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow's shoulders, and bound the little boy’s head with a white handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow on a chair by the door with an apple in her little daughter’s hand. Soon after this, a good and beautiful wife came up to a good and beautiful wife's mother who was stirring a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘a good and beautiful wife, a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow is sitting by the door with a beautiful apple in her little daughter’s hand, and a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow looks so pale; and when a good and beautiful wife asked a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow to give a good and beautiful wife a beautiful apple, a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow did not answer, and answer frightened a good and beautiful wife.’ ‘Go to a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow again,’ said a good and beautiful wife, ‘and if a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow does not answer, give a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow a box on the ear.’ So a good and beautiful wife went, and said, ‘a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow, give a good and beautiful wife a beautiful apple,’ but a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow did not say a word; then a good and beautiful wife gave a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow a box on the earthe ear, and the little boy’s head rolled off. a good and beautiful wife was so terrified at this, that a good and beautiful wife ran crying and screaming to a good and beautiful wife. ‘Oh!’ a good and beautiful wife said, ‘a good and beautiful wife have knocked off the little boy’s head,’ and then a good and beautiful wife wept and wept, and nothing would stop a good and beautiful wife. ‘What have a good and beautiful wife done!’ said a good and beautiful wife, ‘but no one must know about it, so a good and beautiful wife must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow into puddings.’ And a good and beautiful wife took a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow and cut a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow up, made a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow into puddings, and put a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow in a pot of boiling water over the fire. But a good and beautiful wife stood looking on, and wept and wept, and a good and beautiful wife's tears fell into a pot of boiling water over the fire, so that there was no need of salt. Presently a rich man came home and sat down to a rich man's dinner; a rich man asked, ‘Where is a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow?’ a good and beautiful wife said nothing, but gave a rich man a large dish of black pudding, and a good and beautiful wife still wept without ceasing. a rich man again asked, ‘Where is a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow?’ ‘Oh,’ answered a good and beautiful wife, ‘a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow is gone into the country to a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow's mother’s great uncle; a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow is going to stay there some time.’ ‘What has a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow gone there for, and a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow never even said goodbye to a rich man!’ ‘Well, a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow likes being there, and a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow told a good and beautiful wife a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow should be away quite six weeks; a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow is well looked after there.’ ‘a rich man feel very unhappy about it,’ said a rich man, ‘in case it should not be all right, and a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow ought to have said goodbye to a rich man.’ With this a rich man went on with his dinner, and said, ‘a good and beautiful wife, why do a good and beautiful wife weep? a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow will soon be back.’ Then a rich man asked a rich man's for more pudding, and as a rich man ate, a rich man threw the bones under the table. a good and beautiful wife went upstairs and took a good and beautiful wife's best silk handkerchief out of a good and beautiful wife's bottom drawer, and in her best silk handkerchief a good and beautiful wife wrapped the bones from under the table and carried the bones outside, and all the time a good and beautiful wife did nothing but weep. Then a good and beautiful wife laid the bones in the green grass under a juniper-tree, and a good and beautiful wife had no sooner done so, then all a good and beautiful wife's sadness seemed to leave a good and beautiful wife, and a good and beautiful wife wept no more. And now a juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping someone clapping their hands for joy's hands for joy. After this a mist came round a juniper-tree, and in the midst of a mist there was a burning as of fire, and out of a burning as of fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently could no more be seen, a juniper-tree stood there as before, and her best silk handkerchief and the bones were gone. a good and beautiful wife now felt as lighthearted and happy as if a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow were still alive, and a good and beautiful wife went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate. a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to sing:  ‘My mother killed My mother's little son;   My's father grieved when My was gone;   My's sister loved My best of all;   My sister laid My sister's kerchief over My,   And took My's that the bones might lie   Underneath a juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently!’ a goldsmith was in a goldsmith's workshop making a gold chain, when a goldsmith heard the song of a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently on a goldsmith's roof. a goldsmith thought the song of the bird on his roof so beautiful that a goldsmith got up and ran out, and as a goldsmith crossed the threshold a goldsmith lost one of a goldsmith's slippers. But a goldsmith ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; a goldsmith still had on a goldsmith's apron, and still held a gold chain and the pincers in a goldsmith's hands, and so a goldsmith stood gazing up at a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street. ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently,’ a goldsmith said, ‘how beautifully a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently sing! Sing a goldsmith the song of the bird on his roof again.’ ‘Nay,’ said a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently do not sing twice for nothing. Give a gold chain, and a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently will sing the song of the bird on his roof a goldsmith again.’ ‘Here is a gold chain, take a gold chain,’ said a goldsmith. ‘Only sing a goldsmith the song of the bird on his roof again.’ a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently flew down and took a gold chain in a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's right claw, and then a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently alighted again in front of a goldsmith and sang:  ‘My's killed her little son;   My father grieved when My was gone;   My sister loved My best of all;   My sister laid her kerchief over My,   And took My's that the bones might lie   Underneath a juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am My!’ Then a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and sang:  ‘My's killed her little son;   My father grieved when My was gone;   My sister loved My best of all;   My sister laid her kerchief over My,   And took My's that the bones might lie   Underneath a juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am My!’ a shoemaker’s heard a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and a shoemaker’s jumped up and ran out in a shoemaker’s's shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently the roof of a shoemaker’s house with a shoemaker’s's hand over a shoemaker’s's eyes to keep a shoemaker’s from being blinded by the sun. ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently,’ a shoemaker’s said, ‘how beautifully a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently sing!’ Then a shoemaker’s called through the door to a shoemaker’s's wife: ‘his wife, come out; here is a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, come and look at a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently and hear how beautifully a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently sings.’ Then a shoemaker’s called a shoemaker’s's daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and saw how splendid a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently was with a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's red and green feathers, and a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's head. ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently,’ said a shoemaker’s, ‘sing a shoemaker’s the song of the bird on his roof again.’ ‘Nay,’ answered a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently do not sing twice for nothing; a shoemaker’s must give a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently something.’ ‘a good and beautiful wife,’ said a shoemaker’s, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf a good and beautiful wife will see a pair of red shoes; bring a pair of red shoes to a shoemaker’s.’ a good and beautiful wife went in and fetched a pair of red shoes. ‘There, a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently,’ said a shoemaker’s, ‘now sing a shoemaker’s the song of the bird on his roof again.’ a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently flew down and took a pair of red shoes in a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's left claw, and then a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently went back to the roof and sang:  ‘My's killed her little son;   My father grieved when My was gone;   My sister loved My best of all;   My sister laid her kerchief over My,   And took My's that the bones might lie   Underneath a juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am My!’ When a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently had finished, a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently flew away. a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently had a gold chain in a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's right claw and the shoes in a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's left, and a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently flew right away to a mill, and a mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside a mill were twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone went ‘Hick hack, hick hack, hick hack,’ a mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently settled on a lime-tree in front of a mill and sang:  ‘My's killed her little son; then one of twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone left off,   My father grieved when My was gone; two more men left off and listened,   My sister loved My best of all; then four more left off,   My sister laid her kerchief over My,   And took My's that the bones might lie now there were only eight at work,   Underneath And now only five,   a juniper-tree. And now only one,   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am My!’ then a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently looked up and the last one had left off work. ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently,’ a rich man said, ‘what a beautiful song that is a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently sing! Let a rich man hear the song of the bird on his roof too; sing the song of the bird on his roof again.’ ‘Nay,’ answered a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently do not sing twice for nothing; give a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently a stone, and a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently will sing the song of the bird on his roof again.’ ‘If a stone belonged to me alone,’ said a rich man, ‘a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently should have a stone.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently will sing again, a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently can have a stone.’ a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently came down, and twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone set to and lifted up a stone with a beam; then a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently put a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's head through the hole and took a stone round a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's neck like a collar, and flew back with a stone to a juniper-tree and sang--  ‘My's killed her little son; My father My father grieved when My was gone;   My sister loved My best of all;   My sister laid her kerchief over My,   And took My's that the bones might lie   Underneath a juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am My!’ And when a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently had finished the song of the bird on his roof, a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently spread a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's wings, and with a gold chain in a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's right claw, the shoes in a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently's left, and the millstone round his neck, a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently flew right away to a shoemaker’s house. a rich man, a good and beautiful wife, and a good and beautiful wife were having The father, the mother, and little Marleen's dinner. ‘How lighthearted a rich man feel,’ said a rich man, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’ ‘And a good and beautiful wife,’ said a good and beautiful wife, ‘a good and beautiful wife feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm were coming.’ But a good and beautiful wife sat and wept and wept. Then a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently came flying towards a shoemaker’s house and settled on the roof. ‘a rich man do feel so happy,’ said a rich man, ‘and how beautifully the sun shines; a rich man feel just as if a rich man were going to see an old friend again.’ ‘Ah!’ said a good and beautiful wife, ‘and a good and beautiful wife am so full of distress and uneasiness that a good and beautiful wife's teeth chatter, and a good and beautiful wife feel as if there were a fire in a good and beautiful wife's veins,’ and a good and beautiful wife tore open a good and beautiful wife's dress; and all the while a good and beautiful wife sat in the corner and wept, and the plate on a good and beautiful wife's knees was wet with her tears. a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently now flew to a juniper-tree and began singing:  ‘My mother killed her little son; My mother shut My mother's eyes and My mother's ears, that My mother might see and hear nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a violent storm, and in My mother's eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:   My's grieved when My was gone; ‘Look, a good and beautiful wife,’ said a shoemaker’s, ‘at a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!’   My sister loved My best of all; then a good and beautiful wife laid a good and beautiful wife's head down on a good and beautiful wife's knees and sobbed. ‘a shoemaker’s must go outside and see a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently nearer,’ said a shoemaker’s. ‘Ah, do not go!’ cried a good and beautiful wife. ‘a good and beautiful wife feel as if a shoemaker’s house were in flames!’ But a shoemaker’s went out and looked at a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently.  a good and beautiful wife laid her kerchief over My,  And took My's that the bones might lie  Underneath a juniper-tree  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently!’ With that a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently let fall a gold chain, and a gold chain fell just round his neck, so that a gold chain fitted a shoemaker’s exactly. a shoemaker’s went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently is; a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently has given a shoemaker’s a gold chain, and looks so beautiful a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently.’ But a good and beautiful wife was in such fear and trouble, that a good and beautiful wife fell on the floor, and a good and beautiful wife's cap fell from a good and beautiful wife's head. Then a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently began again:  ‘My mother killed her little son; ‘Ah me!’ cried a good and beautiful wife, ‘if a good and beautiful wife were but a thousand feet beneath all the earth, that a good and beautiful wife might not hear the song of the bird on his roof.’   My's grieved when My was gone; then a good and beautiful wife fell down again as if dead.   My sister loved My best of all; ‘Well,’ said a good and beautiful wife, ‘a good and beautiful wife will go out too and see if a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently will give a good and beautiful wife anything.’ So a good and beautiful wife went out.   a good and beautiful wife laid her kerchief over My,   And took My's that the bones might lie and a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently threw down a pair of red shoes to a good and beautiful wife,   Underneath a juniper-tree   Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am a good and beautiful wife!’ And a good and beautiful wife now felt quite happy and lighthearted; a good and beautiful wife put on a pair of red shoes and danced and jumped about in a pair of red shoes. ‘a good and beautiful wife was so miserable,’ a good and beautiful wife said, ‘when a good and beautiful wife came out, but that has all passed away; a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently is indeed a splendid bird, and a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently has given a good and beautiful wife a pair of red shoes.’ a good and beautiful wife sprang up, with a good and beautiful wife's hair standing out from a good and beautiful wife's head like flames of fire. ‘Then a good and beautiful wife will go out too,’ a good and beautiful wife said, ‘and see if it will lighten a good and beautiful wife's misery, for a good and beautiful wife feel as if the world were coming to an end.’ But as a good and beautiful wife crossed the threshold, crash! a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently threw the millstone down on a good and beautiful wife's head, and a good and beautiful wife was crushed to death. a rich man and a good and beautiful wife heard the sound and ran out, but The father and little Marleen only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when mist and flame and fire had passed, there stood the little brother, and the little brother took The father and little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside together and sat down to they all three's dinners and ate.","[[[14, 22], [24, 24], [34, 34], [42, 42], [60, 60]], [[18, 22], [49, 50], [86, 87], [99, 99], [104, 104], [106, 106], [122, 123], [128, 128], [147, 147], [152, 152], [157, 157], [163, 163],

41,THE TURNIP,"There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well, and sowed turnips. When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’ Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’ The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his. When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth? The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him. When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother. So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree. But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out his head. When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’ Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge. The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said, ‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me.’ So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he, ‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace, till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’ So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.","There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the other poor. the one thought the one would try to better the one; so, pulling off the one's red coat, the one became a gardener, and dug the one's ground well, and sowed turnips.

One day the one said to the one, ‘What shall the one do with one plant bigger than all the rest? if the one sell one plant bigger than all the rest, one plant bigger than all the rest will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry one plant bigger than all the rest and give one plant bigger than all the rest to the king as a mark of respect.’ Then the one yoked two oxen, and drew one plant bigger than all the rest to the court, and gave one plant bigger than all the rest to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘the king have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this the king never saw. Where did the one get the seed? or is it only the one's good luck? If so, the one are a true child of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the one, ‘the one am no child of fortune; the one am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so the one laid aside his red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. the one have a brother, who is rich, and the king knows a brother, who is rich well, and all the world knows a brother, who is rich; but because the one am poor, everybody forgets the one.’ the king then took pity on the one, and said, ‘the one shall be poor no longer. the king will give the one so much that the one shall be even richer than a brother, who is rich.’ Then the king gave the one gold and lands and flocks, and made the one so rich that a brother, who is rich fortune could not at all be compared with the one. When a brother, who is rich heard of all this, and how one plant bigger than all the rest had made the one so rich, a brother, who is rich envied the one sorely, and bethought a brother, who is rich how a brother, who is rich could contrive to get the same good fortune for a brother, who is rich. However, a brother, who is rich determined to manage more cleverly than a brother, who is rich, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought a brother, who is rich must have a much larger gift in return; for if a brother, who is rich had received so much for only a turnip, what must a rich present of gold and fine horses be worth? the king took a rich present of gold and fine horses very graciously, and said the king knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than one plant bigger than all the rest; so a brother, who is rich was forced to put one plant bigger than all the rest into a cart, and drag one plant bigger than all the rest home with a brother, who is rich. When a brother, who is rich reached home, a brother, who is rich knew not upon whom to vent a brother, who is rich's rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into a brother, who is rich's head, and a brother, who is rich resolved to kill a brother, who is rich. So a brother, who is rich hired some villains to murder a brother, who is rich; and having shown some villains where to lie in ambush, a brother, who is rich went to a brother, who is rich, and said, ‘a brother, who is rich, a brother, who is rich have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig a hidden treasure up, and share a hidden treasure between us.’ a brother, who is rich had no suspicions of a brother, who is rich's roguery: so us went out together, and as us were travelling along, some villains rushed out upon a brother, who is rich, bound a brother, who is rich, and were going to hang a brother, who is rich on a tree. But whilst some villains were getting all ready, some villains heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened some villains that some villains pushed some villains's neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung a brother, who is rich up by a cord to the tree, where some villains left a brother, who is rich dangling, and ran away. Meantime a brother, who is rich worked and worked away, till a brother, who is rich made a hole large enough to put out a brother, who is rich's head. When the horseman came up, the horseman proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went's nag, and singing as a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went went. As soon as the one a sack saw the one passing under a tree, the one cried out, ‘Good morning! good morning to the one, the one!’ the one looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from, cried out, ‘Who calls the one?’ Then the one a tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here the one sit in a sack; here have the one, in a short time, learned great and wondrous things. Compared to a sack, all the learning of the schools is as empty air. A little longer, and the one shall know all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here the one discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones. Wert the one but once here, the one, though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge. the one listened to all this and wondered much; at last the one said, ‘Blessed be the day and hour when the one found a brother, who is rich; cannot a brother, who is rich contrive to let the one into a sack for a little while?’ Then a brother, who is rich answered, as if very unwillingly, ‘A little space a brother, who is rich may allow the one to sit here, if the one wilt reward a brother, who is rich well and entreat a brother, who is rich kindly; but the one must tarry yet an hour below, till a brother, who is rich have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to a brother, who is rich.’ So the one sat the one down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon the one, and the one begged earnestly that the one might ascend forthwith, for the one's thirst for knowledge was great. Then a brother, who is rich pretended to give way, and said, ‘the one must let a sack descend, by untying yonder cord, and then the one shalt enter.’ So the one let a brother, who is rich down, opened a sack, and set a brother, who is rich free. ‘Now then,’ cried the one, ‘let the one ascend quickly.’ As the one began to put the one into a sack heels first, ‘Wait a while,’ said the one, ‘put is not the way.’ Then the one pushed the one in head first, tied up a sack, and soon swung up a brother, who is rich after wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with the one, the one?’ said the one, ‘dost the one not feel that wisdom comes unto the one? Rest there in peace, till the one art a wiser man than the one wert.’ So saying, the one trotted off on his nag, and left a brother, who is rich to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let a brother, who is rich down.","[[[9, 10], [18, 20], [22, 22], [27, 27], [33, 33], [37, 37], [44, 44], [133, 134], [157, 157], [161, 161], [164, 164], [169, 169], [175, 175], [221, 221], [223, 223], [272, 272], [281, 281], [288, 288], [304, 305], [308, 308], [315, 315], [331, 331], [334, 334], [347, 347], [372, 372], [378, 378], [387, 387], [393, 393], [403, 403], [407, 407], [413, 413], [420, 420], [429, 429], [433, 433], [444, 444], [460, 461], [467, 467], [833, 837], [839, 839], [845, 845], [856, 856], [858, 858], [858, 859], [862, 863], [888, 888], [892, 896], [908, 908], [918, 918], [952, 952], [973, 973], [1023, 1023], [1028, 1028], [1028, 1029], [1041, 1042], [1053, 1053], [1064, 1064], [1074, 1074], [1101, 1101], [1107, 1107], [1118, 1118], [1142, 1143], [1145, 1145], [1158, 1158], [1161, 1161], [1165, 1165], [1171, 1171], [1190, 1190], [1206, 1206], [1212, 1213], [1233, 1233], [1237, 1237], [1243, 1243], [1247, 1247], [1261, 1262], [1273, 1273], [1275, 1275], [1303, 1303], [1305, 1305], [1309, 1309], [1313, 1313], [1320, 1320], [1328, 1328], [1334, 1334], [1341, 1341], [1345, 1347]], [[60, 66], [69, 69], [80, 80], [88, 88], [114, 114], [119, 119], [144, 144], [148, 148], [172, 172], [177, 177], [179, 179], [206, 206], [209, 209], [228, 229], [236, 236], [456, 457], [568, 570], [579, 579], [586, 586]], [[121, 122], [130, 130], [581, 582]], [[125, 126], [223, 224]], [[211, 212], [238, 239], [249, 250], [253, 253], [266, 266], [357, 358], [381, 382], [400, 400], [418, 418], [510, 511], [545, 546], [555, 555]], [[197, 197], [265, 265]], [[53, 54], [274, 275]], [[33, 35], [334, 336]], [[349, 354], [360, 360], [368, 368], [413, 414], [433, 435], [447, 448], [465, 465], [472, 472], [474, 474], [484, 484], [488, 488], [495, 495], [495, 496], [515, 515], [527, 527], [527, 528], [540, 540], [573, 574], [589, 589], [592, 592], [596, 596], [603, 603], [615, 615], [619, 619], [623, 623], [623, 624], [627, 627], [633, 633], [645, 645], [648, 648], [648, 649], [655, 656], [658, 658], [680, 681], [686, 686], [707, 707], [710, 710], [717, 717], [748, 749], [760, 760], [772, 772], [780, 780], [787, 787], [796, 796], [1066, 1066], [1070, 1070], [1085, 1086], [1098, 1098], [1110, 1110], [1114, 1114], [1127, 1127], [1138, 1138], [1179, 1180], [1215, 1215], [1224, 1224], [1289, 1290], [1352, 1354], [1364, 1364]], [[501, 508], [540, 541], [548, 549]], [[629, 630], [638, 638], [702, 703], [724, 724], [730, 730], [744, 744], [746, 746], [748, 748], [770, 770]], [[661, 663], [670, 670], [675, 675]], [[666, 666], [677, 677], [690, 690], [697, 697]], [[800, 801], [805, 805]], [[809, 828], [821, 821], [827, 827]], [[755, 756], [836, 837], [911, 914], [933, 934], [1076, 1077], [1193, 1196], [1219, 1220], [1249, 1250], [1282, 1283]], [[719, 720], [842, 843], [895, 896]], [[1246, 1246], [1265, 1265]], [[821, 822], [1345, 1348]]]"

Then Gretel became angry, tore Gretel loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.","[[[3, 3], [10, 10], [13, 13], [25, 25], [31, 31], [44, 44], [47, 47], [63, 63], [67, 67], [75, 75], [79, 79], [85, 85], [90, 90], [95, 95], [107, 107], [110, 110], [140, 140], [144, 144], [156, 156], [168, 168], [176, 176], [181, 181], [192, 192], [210, 210], [212, 212], [219, 219], [227, 227], [239, 239], [253, 253], [259, 259], [272, 272], [275, 275], [291, 291], [295, 295], [303, 303], [307, 307], [314, 314], [319, 319], [333, 333], [336, 336], [344, 344], [362, 362], [366, 366], [377, 377], [389, 389], [398, 398], [403, 403], [414, 414], [420, 420], [430, 430], [432, 432], [439, 439], [458, 458], [472, 472], [478, 478], [491, 491], [494, 494], [510, 510], [516, 516], [521, 521], [525, 525], [529, 529], [534, 534], [549, 549], [552, 552], [565, 565], [569, 569], [587, 587], [591, 591], [603, 603], [614, 614], [623, 623], [629, 629], [640, 640], [647, 647], [657, 657], [659, 659], [687, 687], [701, 701], [707, 707], [720, 720], [723, 723], [739, 739], [745, 745], [750, 750], [754, 754], [758, 758], [763, 763], [779, 779], [782, 782], [798, 798], [809, 809], [813, 813], [818, 818], [843, 843], [847, 847], [859, 859], [865, 865], [872, 872], [881, 881], [886, 886], [899, 899], [903, 903], [925, 925], [927, 927], [934, 934], [953, 953], [967, 967], [971, 971], [984, 984], [987, 987], [1003, 1003], [1009, 1009], [1014, 1014], [1027, 1027], [1041, 1041], [1044, 1044], [1052, 1052], [1059, 1059], [1073, 1073], [1077, 1077], [1089, 1089], [1095, 1095], [1103, 1103], [1111, 1111], [1122, 1122], [1126, 1126], [1130, 1130], [1134, 1134], [1139, 1139], [1149, 1149], [1151, 1151], [1181, 1181], [1195, 1195], [1199, 1199], [1212, 1212], [1215, 1215], [1231, 1231], [1237, 1237], [1242, 1242], [1256, 1256], [1263, 1263], [1266, 1266], [1288, 1288], [1291, 1291], [1305, 1305], [1309, 1309], [1321, 1321], [1327, 1327], [1338, 1338], [1344, 1344], [1350, 1350], [1356, 1356], [1362, 1362], [1389, 1389], [1391, 1391], [1410, 1410], [1454, 1454]], [[0, 3], [38, 38], [133, 133], [246, 246], [266, 266], [355, 355], [465, 465], [485, 485], [580, 580], [714, 714], [836, 836], [960, 960], [978, 978], [1066, 1066], [1188, 1188], [1206, 1206], [1291, 1292], [1298, 1298]], [[18, 18], [50, 50], [56, 56], [88, 88], [101, 101], [150, 150], [158, 158], [174, 174], [244, 244], [278, 278], [284, 284], [317, 317], [327, 327], [372, 372], [379, 379], [384, 384], [387, 387], [396, 396], [463, 463], [497, 497], [503, 503], [532, 532], [543, 543], [597, 597], [605, 605], [612, 612], [621, 621], [627, 627], [692, 692], [726, 726], [732, 732], [761, 761], [773, 773], [853, 853], [861, 861], [867, 867], [870, 870], [879, 879], [958, 958], [990, 990], [996, 996], [1025, 1025], [1035, 1035], [1083, 1083], [1091, 1091], [1109, 1109], [1186, 1186], [1218, 1218], [1224, 1224], [1253, 1253], [1259, 1259], [1268, 1268], [1271, 1271], [1277, 1277], [1284, 1284], [1315, 1315], [1323, 1323], [1329, 1329], [1336, 1336], [1342, 1342], [1347, 1347], [1358, 1358], [1364, 1364], [1370, 1370], [1380, 1380], [1398, 1398], [1431, 1432], [1436, 1436], [1441, 1441]], [[92, 93], [112, 113], [116, 116], [182, 183], [189, 190], [216, 217]], [[118, 121], [125, 126], [198, 201]], [[205, 205], [215, 215], [425, 425], [435, 435]], [[321, 322], [338, 339], [342, 342], [404, 405], [411, 412], [436, 437]], [[219, 220], [344, 345], [420, 421]], [[231, 232], [450, 451], [679, 680], [945, 946], [1173, 1174]], [[536, 538], [554, 555], [558, 558], [563, 563], [572, 572], [630, 631], [637, 638], [645, 645], [666, 668]], [[439, 440], [565, 566], [647, 648]], [[644, 644], [652, 652]], [[765, 768], [784, 785], [788, 788], [795, 795], [805, 806], [887, 890], [896, 897], [905, 905], [911, 911], [916, 916], [931, 932]], [[790, 791], [815, 816], [830, 830], [1366, 1367]], [[800, 801], [914, 914]], [[1029, 1030], [1046, 1047], [1050, 1050], [1056, 1057], [1115, 1116], [1123, 1124], [1132, 1132], [1137, 1137], [1155, 1156], [1160, 1160]], [[934, 935], [1052, 1053], [1134, 1135]], [[1059, 1060], [1139, 1140]], [[1279, 1280], [1372, 1373]], [[1418, 1425], [1429, 1429]]]"
43,THE THREE LANGUAGES,"An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you learnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I will send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back the father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered: ‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a rage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token. The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble. After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in his ear.","An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but an only son was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said An aged count: ‘Hark an only son, An aged count's , try as An aged count will An aged count can get nothing into an only son's head. an only son must go from hence, An aged count will give an only son into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you can do with an only son.’ an only son was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you. At the end of a whole year, an only son came home again, and An aged count asked: ‘Now, An aged count's , what have an only son learnt?’ ‘An aged count, an only son have learnt what the dogs say when the dogs bark.’ ‘Lord have mercy on us!’ cried An aged count; ‘is that all an only son have learnt?

Then an only son had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of a mass, but two snow-white doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in an only son's ear.","[[[10, 12], [15, 15], [31, 31], [33, 34], [45, 45], [48, 48], [57, 57], [74, 74], [77, 78], [102, 102], [108, 108], [115, 116], [120, 120], [127, 127], [155, 155], [162, 162], [172, 173], [188, 188], [197, 198], [202, 202], [206, 206], [212, 212], [234, 236], [238, 238], [249, 249], [261, 261], [269, 269], [281, 281], [285, 286], [299, 299], [305, 305], [310, 311], [315, 315], [319, 319], [326, 326], [359, 360], [364, 365], [369, 369], [377, 377], [385, 385], [390, 390], [399, 399], [411, 411], [438, 439], [452, 452], [473, 473], [491, 491], [499, 499], [560, 561], [575, 575], [585, 585], [588, 588], [600, 600], [604, 605], [605, 605], [613, 613], [623, 623], [630, 630], [640, 640], [649, 649], [653, 653], [665, 665], [677, 677], [700, 700], [752, 752], [786, 786], [791, 791], [796, 796], [803, 803], [806, 806], [811, 811], [825, 825], [855, 855], [859, 859], [862, 862], [871, 871], [887, 887], [894, 894], [903, 903], [912, 912], [973, 975], [990, 990], [1008, 1008], [1013, 1013], [1018, 1018], [1026, 1026], [1036, 1036], [1044, 1044], [1050, 1050], [1060, 1060], [1067, 1067], [1074, 1074], [1077, 1077], [1081, 1081], [1087, 1087], [1110, 1110], [1118, 1118]], [[0, 2], [26, 27], [33, 33], [38, 38], [40, 40], [54, 54], [108, 109], [115, 115], [125, 125], [148, 149], [159, 159], [191, 192], [197, 197], [210, 210], [222, 223], [255, 255], [258, 258], [276, 276], [281, 282], [305, 306], [310, 310], [323, 324], [338, 339], [351, 351], [364, 364], [367, 367], [431, 433]], [[62, 74], [70, 70], [92, 93]], [[88, 90], [99, 100]], [[131, 132], [135, 135]], [[168, 169], [183, 184]], [[263, 265], [292, 294]], [[351, 352], [374, 374], [388, 388], [395, 395], [401, 401], [415, 415], [426, 426], [611, 611]], [[398, 398], [405, 405]], [[417, 420], [429, 429]], [[449, 458], [468, 469], [691, 692], [780, 781]], [[465, 469], [489, 489], [688, 692], [777, 781], [783, 783]], [[507, 515], [528, 528], [531, 531], [547, 547], [579, 581], [592, 592], [594, 594], [634, 635], [644, 644], [656, 656], [695, 696], [703, 703], [708, 708], [719, 719], [740, 740], [758, 758], [830, 832], [839, 839]], [[481, 483], [626, 627], [736, 737]], [[729, 737], [746, 746]], [[762, 762], [793, 793], [813, 813]], [[879, 882], [890, 890], [899, 899]], [[866, 866], [915, 922]], [[930, 931], [935, 935], [942, 942], [997, 998]], [[918, 919], [939, 939]], [[951, 951], [968, 968]], [[959, 963], [1001, 1004]], [[1015, 1015], [1030, 1030], [1039, 1039]], [[983, 987], [1033, 1034], [1104, 1106]], [[1016, 1016], [1081, 1084]], [[1091, 1092], [1101, 1101]], [[990, 991], [1110, 1111]]]"
44,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’ said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’","It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as the cat thought to the cat: ‘the fox is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,’ the cat spoke to the fox in a friendly way. ‘Good day, the fox, how are the fox?

45,THE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS,"‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for himself.’ So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’ said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon. The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from you.’ The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’ The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’ ‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me, and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said, ‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’ After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other, set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had happened to them, and how each had learned some craft. Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’ ‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird; and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished. ‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where the tailor had sewn them together. ‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!’ Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’ said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’ ‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it, but went on snoring. Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe. When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman; ‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.","‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to Dear children, ‘a poor man have nothing to give Dear children; Dear children must go out into the wide world and try Dear children's luck. Begin by learning some craft or another, and see how Dear children can get on.’ So Dear children took Dear children's walking-sticks in Dear children's hands, and Dear children's little bundles on Dear children's shoulders, and after bidding Dear children's goodbye, went all out at the gate together. When Dear children had got on some way Dear children came to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest said, ‘Here Dear children must part; but this day four years Dear children will come back to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what each can do for each.’ So each brother went each's way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man met the eldest, and asked the eldest where the eldest was going, and what the eldest wanted. ‘the eldest am going to try the eldest's luck in the wide world, and should like to begin by learning some art or trade,’ answered the eldest. ‘Then,’ said a man, ‘go with a man, and a man will teach the eldest to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’ said the other, ‘become is not an honest calling, and what can one look to earn by become in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said a man, ‘the other need not fear the gallows; for a man will only teach the other to steal what will be fair game: a man meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care anything about, and where no one can find the other out.’ So the other agreed to follow the other's trade, and the other soon showed the other so clever, that nothing could escape the other that the other had once set the other's mind upon. The second brother also met a man, who, when The second brother found out what The second brother was setting out upon, asked The second brother what craft The second brother meant to follow. ‘The second brother do not know yet,’ said The second brother. ‘Then come with The second brother, and be a star-gazer. be is a noble art, for nothing can be hidden from The second brother, when once The second brother understand the stars.’ The plan pleased The second brother much, and The second brother soon became such a skilful star-gazer, that when The second brother had served out The second brother's time, and wanted to leave The second brother, The second brother gave The second brother a glass, and said, ‘With a glass The second brother can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from The second brother.’ The third brother met a huntsman, who took The third brother with a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, and taught The third brother so well all that belonged to hunting, that The third brother became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when The third brother left The third brother's The third brother gave The third brother a bow, and said, ‘Whatever The third brother shoot at with a bow The third brother will be sure to hit.’ The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked The youngest brother what The youngest brother wished to do. ‘Would not The youngest brother like,’ said a man who asked him what he wished to do, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said The youngest brother; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit The youngest brother.’ ‘Oh!’ answered a man who asked him what he wished to do, ‘sitting is not a man who asked him what he wished to do's sort of tailoring; come with a man who asked him what he wished to do, and The youngest brother will learn quite another kind of craft from sitting.’ Not knowing what better to do, The youngest brother came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when The youngest brother left The youngest brother's , The second brother gave The youngest brother a needle, and said, ‘The youngest brother can sew anything with a needle, be anything as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’ After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, Dear children met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other, set off towards Dear children's home, where Dear children told a poor man all that had happened to Dear children, and how each had learned some craft. Then, one day, as Dear children were sitting before the house under a very high tree, a poor man said, ‘a poor man should like to try what each of Dear children can do in this way.’ So a poor man looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of a very high tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell a poor man how many eggs there are in a chaffinch’s nest.’ the second son took the second son's glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’ ‘Now,’ said a poor man to the eldest son, ‘take away Five without letting the bird that is sitting upon Five and hatching Five know anything of what the eldest son are doing.’ So the eldest son climbed up a very high tree, and brought away to the eldest son's Five from under the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them; and the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them never saw or felt what the eldest son was doing, but kept sitting on at the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them's ease.

Then the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them went on sitting, and hatched Five: and in a few days Five crawled out, and had only a little red streak across Five's necks, where your had sewn Five together. ‘Well done, Dear children!’ said a poor man; ‘Dear children have made good use of Dear children's time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but a poor man am sure a poor man do not know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for Dear children to turn Dear children's skill to some account!’ Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for a poor man's daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and a poor man mourned over a poor man's loss day and night, and made it known that whoever brought the king’s daughter back to a poor man should have the king’s daughter for a wife. Then Dear children said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for Dear children; let Dear children try what Dear children can do.’ And Dear children agreed to see whether Dear children could not set the king’s daughter free. ‘the second son will soon find out where the king’s daughter is, however,’ said the second son, as the second son looked through his glass; and the second son soon cried out, ‘the second son see the king’s daughter afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and the second son can spy a mighty dragon close by, guarding the king’s daughter.’ Then the second son went to a poor man, and asked for a ship for the second son and the second son's ; and himself and his brothers sailed together over the sea, till himself and his brothers came to the right place. There himself and his brothers found the king’s daughter sitting, as the second son had said, on a rock in the sea; and a mighty dragon was lying asleep, with a mighty dragon's head upon the king’s daughter's lap. ‘the huntsman dare not shoot at a mighty dragon,’ said the huntsman, ‘for the huntsman should kill the king’s daughter also.’ ‘Then the eldest son will try your skill,’ said the eldest son, and went and stole the king’s daughter away from under a mighty dragon, so quietly and gently that a mighty dragon did not know stole, but went on snoring.

When himself and his brothers had brought home the king’s daughter to the king’s daughter's , there was great rejoicing; and a poor man said to Dear children, ‘One of Dear children shall marry the king’s daughter, but Dear children must settle amongst Dear children which it is to be.’ Then there arose a quarrel between Dear children; and the second son said, ‘If the second son had not found the king’s daughter out, all Dear children's skill would have been of no use; therefore the king’s daughter ought to be the second son.’ ‘the second son's seeing the king’s daughter would have been of no use,’ said the eldest son, ‘if the eldest son had not taken the king’s daughter away from a mighty dragon; therefore the king’s daughter ought to be the eldest son.’ ‘No, the king’s daughter is mine,’ said the huntsman; ‘for if the huntsman had not killed a mighty dragon, a mighty dragon would, after all, have torn Dear children and the king’s daughter into pieces.’ ‘And if your had not sewn their boat together again,’ said your, ‘Dear children would all have been drowned, therefore the king’s daughter is mine.’ Then a poor man put in a word, and said, ‘Each of Dear children is right; and as all cannot have the king’s daughter, the best way is for neither of Dear children to have the king’s daughter: for the truth is, there is somebody the king’s daughter likes a great deal better. But to make up for Dear children's loss, a poor man will give each of Dear children, as a reward for each of you's skill, half a kingdom.’ So Dear children agreed that the plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have Dear children. And a poor man then gave to each half a kingdom, as a poor man had said; and each lived very happily the rest of each's days, and took good care of each's ; and somebody took better care of the king’s daughter, than to let either a mighty dragon or one of the craftsmen have the king’s daughter again.","[[[6, 8], [10, 10], [15, 15], [76, 77], [776, 778], [784, 784], [818, 819], [823, 823], [840,

46,LILY AND THE LION,"A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father, bring me a rose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all three, and bid them goodbye. And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers. This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!’ Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden belonged to you; can nothing save my life?’ ‘No!’ said the lion, ‘nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be my youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when I go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return. And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest daughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, ‘Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her all that had happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen. But she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father, the word you have given must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let me come safe home again.’ The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself, she knew not whither, till the night came again. After some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood. Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to go to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go alone this time--you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, ‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free.’ This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove. ‘Now,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man can be of use to me.’ So she went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s top and the valley’s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it; but I will give thee a casket--open it when thy hour of need comes.’ So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the night, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg--break it when need comes.’ Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the night-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen it.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove--he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘I will give thee counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home. I will also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind. ‘When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let you both fall into the sea.’ So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went off carrying the prince away with her. Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went on for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and she heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me now!’ said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ‘but for flesh and blood.’ The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.’ At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ‘I have followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the prince all the time slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees. Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.’ Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the chamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour.’ And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea. When they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water, and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.","A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey; but before A merchant, who had three daughters went A merchant, who had three daughters asked each daughter what gift A merchant, who had three daughters should bring back for each daughter. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘A merchant, who had three daughters, bring the third, who was called Lily a rose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle of winter; yet as the third, who was called Lily was A merchant, who had three daughters's prettiest daughter, and was very fond of flowers, the third, who was called Lily's said A merchant, who had three daughters would try what A merchant, who had three daughters could do. So A merchant, who had three daughters kissed three daughters, and bid three daughters goodbye. And when the time came for A merchant, who had three daughters to go home, A merchant, who had three daughters had bought pearls and jewels for The eldest, but A merchant, who had three daughters had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when A merchant, who had three daughters went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at A merchant, who had three daughters, and asked A merchant, who had three daughters whether A merchant, who had three daughters thought roses grew in snow. This grieved A merchant, who had three daughters very much, for the third, who was called Lily was A merchant, who had three daughters's dearest child; and as A merchant, who had three daughters was journeying home, thinking what A merchant, who had three daughters should bring the third, who was called Lily, A merchant, who had three daughters came to a fine castle; and around a fine castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said A merchant, who had three daughters, as A merchant, who had three daughters called to A merchant, who had three daughters's servant, and told his servant to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring A merchant, who had three daughters away one of the finest flowers. This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen a fierce lion's roses shall be eaten up alive!’ Then A merchant, who had three daughters said, ‘A merchant, who had three daughters knew not that a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half belonged to a fierce lion; can nothing save A merchant, who had three daughters's life?’ ‘No!’ said a fierce lion, ‘nothing, unless A merchant, who had three daughters undertake to give a fierce lion whatever meets A merchant, who had three daughters on A merchant, who had three daughters's return home; if A merchant, who had three daughters agree to this, a fierce lion will give A merchant, who had three daughters my life, and the rose too for the third, who was called Lily.’ But A merchant, who had three daughters was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be A merchant, who had three daughters's youngest daughter, who loves A merchant, who had three daughters most, and always runs to meet A merchant, who had three daughters when A merchant, who had three daughters go home.’ Then his servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last A merchant, who had three daughters yielded with a heavy heart, and took one of the finest flowers; and said A merchant, who had three daughters would give a fierce lion whatever should meet A merchant, who had three daughters first on A merchant, who had three daughters's return. And as A merchant, who had three daughters came near home, it was the third, who was called Lily, that met A merchant, who had three daughters; the third, who was called Lily came running, and kissed A merchant, who had three daughters, and welcomed A merchant, who had three daughters home; and when the third, who was called Lily saw that A merchant, who had three daughters had brought the third, who was called Lily one of the finest flowers, the third, who was called Lily was still more glad. But the third, who was called Lily's began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, ‘Alas, the third, who was called Lily! A merchant, who had three daughters have bought one of the finest flowers at a high price, for A merchant, who had three daughters have said A merchant, who had three daughters would give the third, who was called Lily to a fierce lion; and when a fierce lion has the third, who was called Lily, a fierce lion will tear the third, who was called Lily in pieces, and eat the third, who was called Lily.’ Then A merchant, who had three daughters told the third, who was called Lily all that had happened, and said the third, who was called Lily should not go, let what would happen. But the third, who was called Lily comforted A merchant, who had three daughters, and said, ‘A merchant, who had three daughters, the word A merchant, who had three daughters have given must be kept; the third, who was called Lily will go to a fierce lion, and soothe a fierce lion: perhaps a fierce lion will let the third, who was called Lily come safe home again.’ The next morning the third, who was called Lily asked the way the third, who was called Lily was to go, and took leave of the third, who was called Lily's , and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But a fierce lion was an enchanted prince. By day a fierce lion and all a fierce lion's court were lions, but in the evening he and all his court took he and all his court's right forms again. And when the third, who was called Lily came to a fine castle, a fierce lion welcomed the third, who was called Lily so courteously that the third, who was called Lily agreed to marry a fierce lion. The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. a fierce lion was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then a fierce lion held all his court; but every morning a fierce lion left a fierce lion's , and went away by a fierce lion, the third, who was called Lily knew not whither, till the night came again. After some time a fierce lion said to the third, who was called Lily, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in the third, who was called Lily's house, for the third, who was called Lily's eldest sister is to be married; and if the third, who was called Lily wish to go and visit your eldest sister her my lions shall lead the third, who was called Lily thither.’ Then the third, who was called Lily rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing the third, who was called Lily's once more, and set out with her my lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see the third, who was called Lily, for everyone had thought the third, who was called Lily dead long since. But the third, who was called Lily told everyone how happy the third, who was called Lily was, and stayed till The wedding-feast was over, and then went back to the wood. your eldest sister was soon after married, and when the third, who was called Lily was asked to go to the wedding, the third, who was called Lily said to a fierce lion, ‘the third, who was called Lily will not go alone this time--a fierce lion must go with the third, who was called Lily.’ But a fierce lion would not, and said that the wedding would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon a fierce lion a fierce lion's enchantment would become still worse, for a fierce lion should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years. However, the third, who was called Lily gave a fierce lion no rest, and said the third, who was called Lily would take care no light should fall upon a fierce lion. So at last they set out together, and took with they they's little child; and the third, who was called Lily chose a large hall with thick walls for a fierce lion to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the wedding-torches before a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted, a very small ray of light fell upon a fierce lion. In a moment a fierce lion disappeared, and when a fierce lion's came in and looked for a fierce lion, the third, who was called Lily found only a white dove; and only a white dove said to the third, who was called Lily, ‘seven long years must only a white dove fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then only a white dove will let fall a white feather, that will show the third, who was called Lily the way only a white dove am going; follow the way I am going, and at last the third, who was called Lily may overtake and set only a white dove free.’ This said, only a white dove flew out at the door, and the third, who was called Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed the third, who was called Lily the way I am going. Thus the third, who was called Lily went roving on through the world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven long years. Then the third, who was called Lily began to be glad, and thought to the third, who was called Lily that the time was fast coming when all the third, who was called Lily's troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one day as the third, who was called Lily was travelling on the third, who was called Lily missed a white feather, and when the third, who was called Lily lifted up the third, who was called Lily's eyes the third, who was called Lily could nowhere see a white feather. ‘Now,’ thought the third, who was called Lily to the third, who was called Lily, ‘no aid of man can be of use to the third, who was called Lily.’ So the third, who was called Lily went to the sun and said, ‘the sun shinest everywhere, on the hill’s top and the valley’s depth--hast the sun anywhere seen a white feather?’ ‘No,’ said the sun, ‘the sun have not seen a white feather; but the sun will give the third, who was called Lily a casket--open a casket when the third, who was called Lily hour of need comes.’ So the third, who was called Lily thanked the sun, and went on the third, who was called Lily's way till eventide; and when the moon arose, the third, who was called Lily cried unto the moon, and said, ‘the sun shinest through the night, over field and grove--hast the sun nowhere seen a white feather?’ ‘No,’ said the moon, ‘the moon cannot help the third, who was called Lily but the moon will give the third, who was called Lily an egg--break an egg when need comes.’ Then the third, who was called Lily thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and the third, who was called Lily raised up the third, who was called Lily's voice to the night-wind, and said, ‘the night-wind blowest through every tree and under every leaf--hast the night-wind not seen a white feather?’ ‘No,’ said the night-wind, ‘but the third, who was called Lily will ask three other winds; perhaps three other winds have seen a white feather.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said the east wind and the west wind too had not seen a white feather, but the south wind said, ‘the south wind have seen a white feather--a fierce lion has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there a fierce lion is fighting with a dragon; and a dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate a fierce lion from the third, who was called Lily.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘the night-wind will give the third, who was called Lily's counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count many rods, and when the third, who was called Lily comest to the eleventh, break the eleventh off, and smite a dragon with the eleventh; and so a fierce lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to the third, who was called Lily in both of them's own forms. Then look round and the third, who was called Lily wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to a griffin, winged like bird's back with the third, who was called Lily as quickly as possible, and a griffin, winged like bird will carry the third, who was called Lily over the waters to the third, who was called Lily's home. the night-wind will also give the third, who was called Lily this nut,’ continued the night-wind. ‘When the third, who was called Lily are half-way over, throw this nut down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which a griffin, winged like bird will be able to rest, otherwise a griffin, winged like bird would not have the strength to bear the third, who was called Lily the whole way; if, therefore, the third, who was called Lily dost forget to throw down this nut, a griffin, winged like bird will let they fall into the Red Sea.’ So the third, who was called Lily went forth, and found all as the night-wind had said; and the third, who was called Lily plucked the eleventh, and smote a dragon, and a fierce lion forthwith became a prince, and a dragon a princess again. But no sooner was a dragon released from the spell, than a dragon seized a prince by the arm and sprang on to a griffin, winged like bird back, and went off carrying a prince away with a dragon. Thus the third, who was called Lily was again forsaken and forlorn; but the third, who was called Lily took heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, the third, who was called Lily will journey on, till the third, who was called Lily find a prince once again.’ the third, who was called Lily went on for a long, long way, till at length the third, who was called Lily came to the castle whither a dragon had carried a prince; and there was a feast got ready, and the third, who was called Lily heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid the third, who was called Lily now!’ said the third, who was called Lily; and the third, who was called Lily took the casket that the sun had given the third, who was called Lily, and found that within the casket that the sun had given her lay a dress as dazzling as the sunthe sun. So the third, who was called Lily put a dress as dazzling as the sun itself on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon the third, who was called Lily; and a dress as dazzling as the sun itself pleased the third, who was called Lily so much that the third, who was called Lily asked whether a dress as dazzling as the sun itself was to be sold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said the third, who was called Lily, ‘but for flesh and blood.’ a dragon asked what the third, who was called Lily meant, and the third, who was called Lily said, ‘Let the third, who was called Lily speak with a prince this night in a prince's chamber, and the third, who was called Lily will give a dragon a dress as dazzling as the sun itself.’ At last a dragon agreed, but a dragon told a dragon's chamberlain to give a prince a sleeping draught, that a prince might not hear or see the third, who was called Lily. When evening came, and a prince had fallen asleep, the third, who was called Lily was led into his chamber, and the third, who was called Lily sat the third, who was called Lily down at a prince's feet, and said: ‘the third, who was called Lily have followed a prince seven years. the third, who was called Lily have been to the sun, the moon, and the night-wind, to seek a prince, and at last the third, who was called Lily have helped a prince to overcome a dragon. Wilt a prince then forget the third, who was called Lily quite?’ But a prince all the time slept so soundly, that the third, who was called Lily's voice only passed over a prince, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees. Then the third, who was called Lily was led away, and forced to give up a dress as dazzling as the sun itself; and when the third, who was called Lily saw that there was no help for the third, who was called Lily, the third, who was called Lily went out into a meadow, and sat the third, who was called Lily down and wept. But as the third, who was called Lily sat the third, who was called Lily bethought the third, who was called Lily of the egg that the moon had given the third, who was called Lily; and when the third, who was called Lily broke the egg that the moon had given her, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world. And the third, who was called Lily rose up and drove a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold before the third, who was called Lily, till a dragon saw a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold from a dragon's window, and was so pleased that a dragon came forth and asked the third, who was called Lily if the third, who was called Lily would sell a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold. ‘Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let a dragon again this evening speak with a prince in his chamber, and a dragon will give the third, who was called Lily a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold.’ Then the third, who was called Lily thought to betray the third, who was called Lily as before, and agreed to what a dragon asked: but when a prince went to his chamber a prince asked her chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And her chamberlain told a prince all--how her chamberlain had given a prince a sleeping draught, and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to a prince in his chamber, and was to come again that night. Then a prince took care to throw away a sleeping draught; and when the third, who was called Lily came and began again to tell a prince what woes had befallen the third, who was called Lily, and how faithful and true to a prince the third, who was called Lily had been, a prince knew a prince's voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘the third, who was called Lily have awakened a prince as from a dream, for a dragon had thrown a spell around a prince, so that a prince had altogether forgotten the third, who was called Lily; but Heaven hath sent the third, who was called Lily to a prince in a lucky hour.’ And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated they on the griffin, who flew back with they over the Red Sea. When they were half-way across the third, who was called Lily let this nut fall into the water, and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the Red Sea, whereon the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea rested for a while, and then carried they safely home. There they found they's child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all they's troubles they lived happily together to the end of they's days.","[[[0, 6], [18, 18], [20, 20], [26, 26], [56,

47,THE FOX AND THE HORSE,"A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift. The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’ However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your leisure.’ This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang, and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his master’s house. ‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.","A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to A farmer: but a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him was now grown too old to work; so A farmer would give a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him nothing more to eat, and said, ‘A farmer want a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him no longer, so take a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him off out of A farmer's stable; A farmer shall not take a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him back again until a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him are stronger than a lion.’ Then A farmer opened the door and turned a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him adrift. a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently a fox met a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him: ‘What’s the matter, a fox's ?’ said a fox, ‘why do a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him hang down a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him's head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him's has forgotten all that a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him have done for A farmer so many years, and because a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him can no longer work A farmer has turned a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him adrift, and says unless a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him become stronger than a lion A farmer will not take a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him back again; what chance can a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him have of that? A farmer knows a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him have none, or A farmer would not talk so.’ However, a fox bid a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him be of good cheer, and said, ‘a fox will help a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him; lie down there, stretch a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead.’ a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him did as a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him was told, and a fox went straight to the lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to the lion who lived in a cave close by, ‘A little way off lies a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him; come with a fox and the lion who lived in a cave close by may make an excellent meal of a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him's carcase.’ the lion who lived in a cave close by was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and when they came to a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him, a fox said, ‘the lion who lived in a cave close by will not be able to eat a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him comfortably here; a fox’ll tell the lion who lived in a cave close by what--a fox will tie the lion who lived in a cave close by fast to a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him's tail, and then the lion who lived in a cave close by can draw a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him to the lion who lived in a cave close by's den, and eat a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him at the lion who lived in a cave close by's leisure.’ This advice pleased the lion who lived in a cave close by, so the lion who lived in a cave close by laid the lion who lived in a cave close by down quietly for a fox to make the lion who lived in a cave close by fast to a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him. But a fox managed to tie the lion who lived in a cave close by's legs together and bound all so hard and fast that with all a fox's strength the lion who lived in a cave close by could not set the lion who lived in a cave close by free. When the work was done, a fox clapped a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up a fox sprang, and moved off, dragging the lion who lived in a cave close by behind a fox. the lion who lived in a cave close by began to roar and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him let a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him sing on, and made a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him's way quietly over the fields to a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him's house. ‘Here a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him is, A farmer,’ said a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him, ‘a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him have got the better of the lion who lived in a cave close by’: and when A farmer saw a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him, A farmer's heart relented, and A farmer said. ‘a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him shalt stay in my stable and be well taken care of.’ And so a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him had plenty to eat, and lived--till a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him died.","[[[0, 1], [13, 13], [26, 27], [40, 40], [52, 52], [55, 55], [72, 72], [163, 164], [173, 173], [185, 185], [200, 200], [216, 216], [223, 223], [518, 520], [528, 528], [546, 547], [549, 549], [553, 553], [558, 558]], [[3, 13], [16, 16], [30, 30], [42, 42], [48, 48], [59, 59], [63, 63], [78, 78], [81, 83], [112, 112], [120, 121], [130, 130], [133, 133], [150, 151], [163, 163], [169, 169], [180, 180], [188, 188], [194, 194], [204, 204], [211, 211], [218, 218], [235, 235], [248, 248], [255, 255], [267, 268], [271, 271], [302, 304], [317, 317], [337, 338], [352, 352], [368, 368], [376, 376], [383, 383], [409, 410], [449, 450], [502, 503], [505, 505], [511, 511], [518, 518], [525, 525], [532, 532], [535, 535], [549, 551], [562, 562], [566, 566], [578, 581], [591, 591]], [[109, 110], [120, 120], [125, 125], [232, 233], [245, 245], [276, 277], [308, 308], [340, 341], [356, 356], [362, 362], [402, 403], [413, 414], [431, 431], [446, 447], [468, 468], [479, 479]], [[281, 289], [294, 294], [310, 310], [321, 322], [345, 345], [359, 359], [365, 365], [373, 373], [378, 378], [385, 385], [392, 393], [396, 396], [398, 398], [406, 406], [418, 418], [433, 433], [437, 437], [476, 477], [481, 482], [541, 541]], [[52, 53], [566, 567]]]"
48,THE BLUE LIGHT,"There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him: ‘You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to her, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented, and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. ‘I see well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’ The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more. ‘Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention, ‘I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away. The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. ‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your commands?’ ‘What my commands are?’ replied the soldier, quite astonished. ‘I must do everything you bid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’ said the soldier; ‘then in the first place help me out of this well.’ The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said to the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man reappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf. ‘At this moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before you at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight. The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: ‘I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to do?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for me.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.’ When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess. ‘Aha! are you there?’ cried the soldier, ‘get to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: ‘Pull off my boots,’ and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed. Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ‘and taken into a soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’ ‘The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until cock-crow. Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think of something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The black manikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him. ‘Do what I bid you,’ replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed. Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him: ‘Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’ His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no fear,’ said the latter to his master. ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.’ Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do not imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.","There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully had received. the king said to a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully: ‘a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully may return to a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's home, the king need a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully no longer, and a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully will not receive any more money, for a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully only receives wages who renders the king service for wages who renders me service for them.’ Then a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully entered a forest. When darkness came on, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully saw a light, which a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully to a witch, ‘or a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ a witch answered, ‘who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will a witch be compassionate, and take a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully in, if a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully will do what a witch wish.’ ‘What do a witch wish?’ said a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully. ‘That a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully should dig all round a witch's garden for a witch, tomorrow.’ a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully consented, and next day laboured with all a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's strength, but could not finish dig by the evening. ‘a witch see well enough,’ said a witch, ‘that a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully can do no more today, but a witch will keep a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully yet another night, in payment for which a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully must tomorrow chop a witch a load of wood, and chop a load of wood small.’ a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully spent the whole day in doing chop, and in the evening a witch proposed that a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully should stay one night more. ‘tomorrow, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully shall only do a witch a very trifling piece of work. Behind a house wherein lived a witch, there is an old dry well, into which a witch's light has fallen, my light burns blue, and never goes out, and a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully shall bring my light up again.’ next day a witch took a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully to an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, and let a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully down in a basket. a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully found my light, and made a witch a signal to draw a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully up again. a witch did draw a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully up, but when a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully came near the edge, a witch stretched down a witch's hand and wanted to take my light away from a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully. ‘No,’ said a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, perceiving a witch's evil intention, ‘a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully will not give a witch my light until a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully am standing with both feet upon the ground.’ a witch fell into a passion, let a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully fall again into an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, and went away. a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully fell without injury on the moist ground, and my light went on burning, but of what use was that to a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully? a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully saw very well that a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully could not escape death. a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully felt in a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's pocket and found a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's tobacco pipe, which was still half full. ‘his tobacco pipe, which was still half full shall be a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's last pleasure,’ thought a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, pulled his tobacco pipe, which was still half full out, lit his tobacco pipe, which was still half full at my light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, and said: ‘a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, what are a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's commands?’ ‘What your commands are?’ replied a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, quite astonished. ‘a little black dwarf must do everything a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully bid a little black dwarf,’ said a little black dwarf. ‘Good,’ said a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully; ‘then in the first place help a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully out of an old dry well, into which my light has fallen.’ a little black dwarf took a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully by the hand, and led a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully through an underground passage, but a little black dwarf did not forget to take my light with a little black dwarf. On the way a little black dwarf showed a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully the treasures which a witch had collected and hidden there, and a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully took as much gold as a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully could carry. When a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully was above, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully said to a little black dwarf: ‘Now go and bind a witch, and carry a witch before the judge.’ In a short time a witch came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before a little black dwarf reappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said a little black dwarf, ‘and a witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has a little black dwarf's ?’ inquired a little black dwarf. ‘At this moment, none,’ answered a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully; ‘a little black dwarf can return home, only be at hand immediately, if a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully summon a little black dwarf.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than that a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully should light his tobacco pipe, which was still half full at my light, and a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully will appear before a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully at once.’ Thereupon a little black dwarf vanished from a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's sight. a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully returned to the town from which a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully came. a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully went to the best inn, ordered a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully a room as handsome as possible. When a room as handsome as possible was ready and a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully had taken possession of a room as handsome as possible, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully summoned a little black dwarf and said: ‘a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully have served the king faithfully, but the king has dismissed a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, and left a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully to hunger, and now a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully want to take a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's revenge.’ ‘What am a little black dwarf to do?’ asked a little black dwarf. ‘Late at night, when the king's daughter is in bed, bring the king’s daughter here in the king’s daughter's sleep, the king’s daughter shall do servant’s work for a little black dwarf.’ a little black dwarf said: ‘do is an easy thing for a little black dwarf to do, but a very dangerous thing for a little black dwarf, for if do is discovered, a little black dwarf will fare ill.’ When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and a little black dwarf carried in the king’s daughter. ‘Aha! are the king’s daughter there?’ cried a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, ‘get to the king’s daughter's work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When the king’s daughter had done this, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully ordered the king’s daughter to come to a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's chair, and then a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully stretched out a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's feet and said: ‘Pull off his feet,’ and then a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully threw his feet in the king’s daughter's face, and made the king’s daughter pick his feet up again, and clean and brighten his feet. the king’s daughter, however, did everything a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully bade the king’s daughter, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, a little black dwarf carried the king’s daughter back to the royal palace, and laid the king’s daughter in the king’s daughter's bed. Next morning when the king’s daughter arose the king’s daughter went to the king’s daughter's , and told the king that the king’s daughter had had a very strange dream. ‘the king’s daughter was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said the king’s daughter, ‘and taken into a soldier’s room, and the king’s daughter had to wait upon a soldier’s like a servant, sweep a soldier’s room, clean a soldier’s's , and do all kinds of menial work. a very strange dream was only a dream, and yet the king’s daughter am just as tired as if the king’s daughter really had done everything.’ ‘a very strange dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘the king will give the king’s daughter a piece of advice. Fill the king’s daughter's pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in your pocket, and then if the king’s daughter are carried away again, peas will fall out and leave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, a little black dwarf was standing beside the king when the king said that, and heard all. At night when the king’s daughter was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of your pocket, but some peas made no track, for a little black dwarf had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the king’s daughter was compelled to do servant’s work until the first cock. Next morning the king sent the king's people out to seek the track, but sent was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think of something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when your go to bed, and before your come back from the place where your are taken, hide one of your shoes there, the king will soon contrive to find one of them.’ a little black dwarf heard this plot, and at night when a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully again ordered a little black dwarf to bring the king’s daughter, revealed this plot to a little black dwarf, and told a little black dwarf that a little black dwarf knew of no expedient to counteract contrive, and that if the shoe were found in a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's house it would go badly with a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully. ‘Do what a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully bid a little black dwarf,’ replied a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, and again this third night the king’s daughter was obliged to work like a servant, but before the king’s daughter went away, the king’s daughter hid the shoe under the bed. Next morning the king had the entire town searched for the shoe. the shoe was found at a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, and a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfullya little black dwarf , was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's flight a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully had forgotten the most valuable things a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully had, my light and the gold, and had only one ducat in a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's pocket. And now loaded with chains, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully was standing at the window of a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's dungeon, when a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully chanced to see one of a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's comrades passing by. a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully tapped at the window of his dungeon, and when one of his comrades came up, said to one of his comrades: ‘Be so kind as to fetch a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully the small bundle a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully have left lying in the best inn, and a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully will give one of his comrades a ducat for doing it.’ one of his comrades ran thither and brought a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully what a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully wanted. As soon as a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully was alone again, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully lighted a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's pipe and summoned a little black dwarf. ‘Have no fear,’ said a little black dwarf to a little black dwarf's . ‘Go wheresoever they take a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, and let they do what they will, only take my light with a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully.’ Next day a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully was tried, and though a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully to death. When a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully was led forth to die, a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully begged a last favour of the king. ‘What is a last favour of the king?’ asked the king. ‘That a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully may smoke one more pipe on a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's way.’ ‘a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do not imagine that the king will spare a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's life.’ Then a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully pulled out a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's pipe and lighted his pipe at my light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, a little black dwarf was there with a small cudgel in a little black dwarf's hand, and said: ‘What does a little black dwarf's command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that false judge there, and that false judge there's constable, and spare not the kinga little black dwarf .’ Then a little black dwarf fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by a small cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. the king was terrified; the king threw the king on a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully's mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully the king's kingdom for the king's own, and the king's daughter to wife.","[[[6, 16], [36, 36], [44, 44], [47, 47], [51, 51], [56, 56], [61, 61], [70, 70], [83, 84], [109, 109], [119, 119], [125, 125], [143, 143], [159, 159], [165, 165], [196, 196], [200, 200], [216,

49,THE RAVEN,"There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’ Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child. Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew near, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me. I shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’ The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch a thing to eat or drink. When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you something to eat and drink.’ ‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’ But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank. As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping. The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank again. Towards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep. As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully to herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him. The following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’ He answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’ But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and took a deep draught. When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in the garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down, he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching, and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her horses, were black. She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words: ‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me free; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg. When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening, thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it. He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him, he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’ So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg. The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns, villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle, but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I be able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said the giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after the child who is in our care.’ The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated, however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for her,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her. Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he called out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’ and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would separate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!’ After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick, and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger, and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom. ‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free.’ She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere. Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.’","There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone. One day a little daughter, still too young to run alone was very troublesome, and a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone could not quiet a little daughter, still too young to run alone, do what a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone would. a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone grew impatient, and seeing the ravens flying round the castle, a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone opened the window, and said: ‘a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone wish you were a raven and would fly away, then a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone should have a little peace.’ Scarcely were the words out of a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone's mouth, when a little daughter, still too young to run alone a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone's was turned into a raven, and flew away from a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone through the window. a raven took a raven's flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of the parents's . Long after this, a man was making a man's way through a dark wood when a man heard a raven calling, and a man followed the sound of the voice. As a man drew near, a raven said, ‘a raven am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under the spell of some enchantment; a man can, however, set a raven free.’ ‘What am a man to do?’ a man asked. a raven replied, ‘Go farther into a dark wood until a man come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; an old woman will offer a man food and drink, but a man must not take of either; if a man do, a man will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help a raven. In the garden behind a house, wherein lives an old woman is a large tan-heap, and on a large tan-heap a man must stand and watch for a raven. a raven shall drive there in a raven's carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the first day my carriage will be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if a man fail to keep awake and a raven find a man sleeping, a raven shall not be set free.’ a man promised to do all that a raven wished, but a raven said, ‘Alas! a raven know even now that a man will take something from an old woman and be unable to save a raven.’ a man assured a raven again that a man would on no account touch a thing to eat or drink. When a man came to a house, wherein lives an old woman and went inside, an old woman met a man, and said, ‘Poor man! how tired a man are! Come in and rest and let an old woman give a man something to eat and drink.’ ‘No,’ answered a man, ‘a man will neither eat not drink.’ But an old woman would not leave a man alone, and urged a man saying, ‘If a man will not eat anything, at least a man might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing,’ and at last a man allowed a man to be persuaded, and drank.

At two o’clock a raven came driving along, drawn by four black horses; but even before a raven reached the spot, a raven said to a raven, sighing, ‘a raven know a man has fallen asleep.’ When a raven entered the garden, there a raven found a man as a raven had feared, lying on a large tan-heap, fast asleep. a raven got out of my carriage and went to a man; a raven called a man and shook a man, but it was all in vain, a man still continued sleeping. The next day at noon, an old woman came to a man again with food and drink which a man at first refused. At last, overcome by an old woman's persistent entreaties that a man would take something, a man lifted the glass and drank again. Towards two o’clock a man went into the garden and on to a large tan-heap to watch for a raven. a man had not been there long before a man began to feel so tired that a man's limbs seemed hardly able to support a man, and a man could not stand upright any longer; so again a man lay down and fell fast asleep. As a raven drove along four black horses, a raven said sorrowfully to a raven, ‘a raven know a man has fallen asleep.’ a raven went as before to look for a man, but a man slept, and it was impossible to awaken a man. The following day an old woman said to a man, ‘What is this? a man are not eating or drinking anything, do a man want to kill a man?’ a man answered, ‘a man may not and will not either eat or drink.’ But an old woman put down the dish of food and the glass in front of a man, and when a man smelt the glass, a man was unable to resist the temptation, and took a deep draught.

When an immense giant who stood in front of it saw a man, an immense giant who stood in front of it called out, ‘It is lucky for that a man have come, for an immense giant who stood in front of it have not had anything to eat for a long time. an immense giant who stood in front of it can have a man now for an immense giant who stood in front of it's supper.’ ‘a man would rather an immense giant who stood in front of it let have alone,’ said a man, ‘for a man do not willingly give a man up to be eaten; if an immense giant who stood in front of it are wanting food a man have enough to satisfy an immense giant who stood in front of it's hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied an immense giant who stood in front of it, ‘an immense giant who stood in front of it will leave a man in peace; an immense giant who stood in front of it only thought of eating a man because an immense giant who stood in front of it had nothing else.’ So they went indoors together and sat down, and a man brought out the bread, meat, and wine, which although a man had eaten and drunk of the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were still unconsumed, were still unconsumed. an immense giant who stood in front of it was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to an immense giant who stood in front of it's heart’s content.

Accordingly, when his brother, who was away in search of provisions had finished his brother, who was away in search of provisions's supper, we went up together to his brother, who was away in search of provisions's room and looked through his brother, who was away in search of provisions's , but the castle was not to be found.

50,THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion. It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst. When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing and went on. But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing. After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home. Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer. When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him. Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers. The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it. The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast. At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they had to spend the night with the goose. The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, wherever his legs took him. In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind. Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi! your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it. Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose. Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’ ‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall be satisfied.’ He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.’ At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished. Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall have my daughter for wife.’ Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted, he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.      [*] Simpleton","There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion. It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before the eldest went the eldest's mother gave the eldest a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that the eldest might not suffer from hunger or thirst. When the eldest entered the forest the eldest met a little grey-haired old man who bade the eldest good day, and said: ‘Do give a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day a piece of cake out of the eldest's pocket, and let a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day have a draught of the eldest's wine; a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day am so hungry and thirsty.’ But the eldest answered: ‘If the eldest give a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine, the eldest shall have none for the eldest; be off with a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day,’ and the eldest left a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day standing and went on. But when the eldest began to hew down a tree, it was not long before the eldest made a false stroke, and the axe cut the eldest in the arm, so that the eldest had to go home and have the arm bound up. And this was a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day doing. After this the second son went into the forest, and the second son's mother gave the second son, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day met the second son likewise, and asked the second son for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What the second son give a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day will be taken away from the second son; be off!’ and the second son left a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day standing and went on. the second son's punishment, however, was not delayed; when the second son had made a few blows at a tree the second son struck the second son in the leg, so that the second son had to be carried home. Then the second son said: ‘Father, do let the second son go and cut wood.’ Father answered: ‘the second son's brothers have hurt Your brothers with wood, leave wood alone, the second son do not understand anything about wood.’ But the second son begged so long that at last the second son said: ‘Just go then, a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day will get wiser by hurting a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day.’ his mother gave the second son a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with a cake made with water and baked in the cinders a bottle of sour beer. When the second son came to the forest a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day met the second son likewise, and greeting the second son, said: ‘Give a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day a piece of a cake made with water and baked in the cinders and a drink out of the second son's bottle; a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day am so hungry and thirsty.’ the second son answered: ‘the second son have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if only cinder-cake and sour beer pleases a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, we will sit down and eat.’ So we sat down, and when the second son pulled out a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, a cake made with water and baked in the cinders was a fine sweet cake, and sour beer had become good wine. So we ate and drank, and after that a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day said: ‘Since the second son have a good heart, and are willing to divide what the second son have, a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day will give the second son good luck. There stands an old tree, cut an old tree down, and the second son will find something at the roots.’ Then a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day took leave of the second son. the second son went and cut down an old tree, and when an old tree fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. the second son lifted a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold up, and taking a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold with the second son, went to an inn where the second son thought the second son would stay the night. Now Father had three daughters, who saw a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of feathers of pure gold. The eldest thought: ‘The eldest shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather,’ and as soon as the second son had gone out The eldest seized a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold by the wing, but The eldest's finger and hand remained sticking fast to a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how The second might get a feather for The second, but The second had scarcely touched The second's sister than The second was held fast. At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But the third did not understand why the third was to keep away. ‘the others are there,’ the third thought, ‘the third may as well be there too,’ and ran to the others; but as soon as the third had touched her sister, the third remained sticking fast to her sister. So they had to spend the night with a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. The next morning the second son took a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold under the second son's arm and set out, without troubling the second son about the three girls who were hanging on to a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. the three girls who were hanging on to it were obliged to run after the second son continually, now left, now right, wherever the second son's legs took the second son. In the middle of the fields the parson met the three girls who were hanging on to it, and when the parson saw the procession the parson said: ‘For shame, the three girls who were hanging on to it, why are the three girls who were hanging on to it running across the fields after the second son? Is running seemly?’ At the same time the parson seized The eldest by the hand in order to pull The eldest away, but as soon as the parson touched The eldest the parson likewise stuck fast, and was the parson obliged to run behind. Before long the sexton came by and saw the sexton's , running behind three girls. the sexton was astonished at running and called out: ‘Hi! your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a christening today!’ and running after the parson the sexton took the parson by the sleeve, but was also held fast to the sleeve. Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with two labourers's hoes from the fields; the parson called out to two labourers and begged that two labourers would set the parson and the sexton free. But two labourers had scarcely touched the sexton when him and the sexton were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind the second son and a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. Soon afterwards the second son came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh's laugh. So a king had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh's laugh should marry a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. When the second son heard a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh, the second son went with a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold and all a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold's train before a king's , and as soon as a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh saw seven of them running on and on, one behind the other, a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh began to laugh quite loudly, and as if a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh would never stop. Thereupon the second son asked to have a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh for the second son's wife; but a king did not like the second son, and made all manner of excuses and said the second son must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine. the second son thought of the second sonthe second son; so the second son went into the forest, and in the same place where the second son had felled the tree, the second son saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. the second son asked a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face what a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face was taking to heart so sorely, and a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face answered: ‘a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face have such a great thirst and cannot quench such a great thirst; cold water a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face cannot stand, a barrel of wine a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face have just emptied, but a barrel of wine I have just emptied to a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face is like a drop on a hot stone!’ ‘There, the second son can help a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face,’ said the second son, ‘just come with the second son and a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face shall be satisfied.’ the second son led a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face into a king cellar, and a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face bent over the huge barrels, and drank and drank till a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face's loins hurt, and before the day was out a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face had emptied the huge barrels. Then the second son asked once more for a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh, but a king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called Dummling, should take away a king's , and a king made a new condition; the second son must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread. the second son did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘his have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is eaten when one has such a hunger as his? his's stomach remains empty, and his must tie his up if his am not to die of hunger.’ At this the second son was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with the second son; his shall eat his full.’ the second son led his to a king's palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from all the flour in the whole Kingdom the second son caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked. his stood before a huge mountain of bread, began to eat, and by the end of one day a huge mountain of bread had vanished. Then the second son for the third time asked for a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh; but a king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water. ‘As soon as the second son come sailing back in a ship which could sail on land and on water,’ said a king, ‘the second son shall have a king's for wife.’ the second son went straight into the forest, and there sat the second sonthe second son the second son's . When the second son heard what the second son wanted, the second son said: ‘Since the second son have given the second son to eat and to drink, the second son will give the second son a ship which could sail on land and on water; and the second son do all this because the second son once were kind to the second son.’ Then the second son gave the second son a ship which could sail on land and on water, and when a king saw that, a king could no longer prevent the second son from having a king's . The wedding was celebrated, and after a king's death, the second son inherited the whole Kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh.

51,THE WATER OF LIFE,"Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’ said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.’ Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said the prince haughtily, and rode on. But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound. Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search of the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish. So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on. But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice. When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever.’ Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock struck twelve. He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel. When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought to himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he said, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’ ‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf, ‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’ The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set them free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them, and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom. Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way. When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead. When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father, but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them. He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days. Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well, brother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble and we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we will let you off.’ The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said, ‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will forgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to shoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my father, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went away through the wood. Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court, with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their people. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’ said the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him. Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was not the right one; and that they must send him away at once. The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to look at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go about his business. The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it, he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to himself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too must go away about his business; and away he went. Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything; how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape, and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they went to nobody knew and nobody cared. And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess. And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.   And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.   And all the good people they danced and they sung,   And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.","Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way off, a king who had three sons. a king who had three sons once fell very ill--so ill that nobody thought a king who had three sons could live. three sons were very much grieved at three sons's sickness; and as three sons were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met three sons and asked what was the matter. three sons told a little old man that three sons's was very ill, and that three sons were afraid nothing could save a king who had three sons. ‘a little old man know what would,’ said a little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If a king who had three sons could have a draught of the Water of Life a king who had three sons would be well again; but the Water of Life is very hard to get.’ Then the eldest son said, ‘the eldest son will soon find the Water of Life’: and the eldest son went to a king who had three sons, and begged that a king who had three sons might go in search of the Water of Life, as the Water of Life was the only thing that could save a king who had three sons. ‘No,’ said a king who had three sons. ‘a king who had three sons had rather die than place the eldest son in such great danger as the eldest son must meet with in the eldest son's journey.’ But the eldest son begged so hard that a king who had three sons let the eldest son go; and the eldest son thought to the eldest son, ‘If the eldest son bring the eldest son's the Water of Life, a king who had three sons will make the eldest son sole heir to a king who had three sons's kingdom.’ Then the eldest son set out: and when the eldest son had gone on the eldest son's way some time the eldest son came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as the eldest son looked around, the eldest son saw standing above the eldest son on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak called to the eldest son and said, ‘the eldest son, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak, a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak?’ said the eldest son haughtily, and rode on. But a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak was enraged at the eldest son's behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon the eldest son; so that as the eldest son rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that the eldest son could not go to step forward: and when the eldest son thought to have turned the eldest son's horse round and go back the way the eldest son came, the eldest son heard a loud laugh ringing round the eldest son, and found that the way was closed behind the eldest son, so that the eldest son was shut in all round. the eldest son next tried to get off his horse and make the eldest son's way on foot, but again a loud laugh rang in the eldest son's ears, and the eldest son found the eldest son unable to move a step, and thus the eldest son was forced to abide spellbound. Meantime a king who had three sons was lingering on in daily hope of the eldest son's return, till at last the eldest son said, ‘a king who had three sons, the eldest son will go in search of the Water of Life.’ For the eldest son thought to the eldest son, ‘the eldest son's brother is surely dead, and his kingdom will fall to the eldest son if the eldest son find the Water of Life.’ a king who had three sons was at first very unwilling to let the eldest son go, but at last yielded to the eldest son's wish. So the eldest son set out and followed the same road which My brother had done, and met with the same elf, who stopped the eldest son at the same spot in the mountains, saying, as before, ‘the eldest son, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind your own affairs, your!’ said the eldest son scornfully, and rode on. But a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak put the same spell upon the eldest son as a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak put on My brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up the eldest son's abode in the heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice. When the eldest son had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son said the youngest son would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted the youngest son should soon be able to make the youngest son's well again. So the youngest son set out, and a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak met the youngest son too at the same spot in the mountains, and said, ‘the youngest son, whither so fast?’ And the youngest son said, ‘the youngest son am going in search of the Water of Life, because the youngest son's is ill, and like to die: can a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak help the youngest son? Pray be kind, and aid the youngest son if a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak can!’ ‘Do the youngest son know where the Water of Life is to be found?’ asked a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak. ‘No,’ said the youngest son, ‘the youngest son do not. Pray tell the youngest son if a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak know.’ ‘Then as the youngest son have spoken to the youngest son kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, the youngest son will tell the youngest son how and where to go. The water the youngest son seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that the youngest son may be able to reach The water you seek in safety, the youngest son will give the youngest son an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of an enchanted castle three times with an iron wand, and the iron door of the castle will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for two hungry lions's prey, but if the youngest son throw two hungry lions two little loaves of bread two hungry lions will let the youngest son pass; then hasten on to The water you seek, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if the youngest son tarry longer the iron door of the castle will shut upon the youngest son for ever.’ Then the eldest son thanked a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak for a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak's friendly aid, and took an iron wand and two little loaves of bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over land, till the eldest son came to the eldest son's journey’s end, and found everything to be as a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak had told the eldest son. the iron door of the castle flew open at the third stroke of an iron wand, and when two hungry lions were quieted the eldest son went on through an enchanted castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around a beautiful hall the eldest son saw several knights sitting in a trance; then the eldest son pulled off several knights's rings and put their rings on the eldest son's own fingers. In another room the eldest son saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which the eldest son also took. Further on the eldest son came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and a beautiful young lady welcomed the eldest son joyfully, and said, if the eldest son would set a beautiful young lady free from the spell that bound a beautiful young lady, his kingdom should be the eldest son's, if the eldest son would come back in a year and marry a beautiful young lady. Then a beautiful young lady told the eldest son that The water you seek was in the palace gardens; and bade the eldest son make haste, and draw what the eldest son wanted before the clock struck twelve. the eldest son walked on; and as the eldest son walked through beautiful gardens the eldest son came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and the eldest son thought to the eldest son, as the eldest son felt tired, that the eldest son would rest the eldest son for a while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around the eldest son. So the eldest son laid the eldest son down, and sleep fell upon the eldest son unawares, so that the eldest son did not wake up till the clock was striking a quarter to twelve. Then the eldest son sprang from a couch dreadfully frightened, ran to The water you seek, filled a cup that was standing by the eldest son full of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as the eldest son was going out of the iron door of the castle the clock struck twelve, and the iron door of the castle fell so quickly upon the eldest son that the iron door of the castle snapped off a piece of the eldest son's heel. When the eldest son found the eldest son safe, the eldest son was overjoyed to think that the eldest son had got the Water of Life; and as the eldest son was going on the eldest son's way homewards, the eldest son passed by the little dwarf, who, when the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You have made a noble prize saw a sword , said, ‘the eldest son have made a noble prize; with a sword the eldest son can at a blow slay whole armies, and two little loaves of bread will never fail the eldest son.’ Then the eldest son thought to the eldest son, ‘the eldest son cannot go home to the eldest son's without the eldest son's ’; so the eldest son said, ‘a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak, cannot a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak tell the eldest son where the eldest son's are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before the eldest son, and never came back?’ ‘a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak have shut three sons up by a charm between two mountains,’ said a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak, ‘because three sons were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’ the eldest son begged so hard for the eldest son's , that a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak at last set three sons free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of three sons, for three sons have bad hearts.’ My brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see three sons, and told three sons all that had happened to My brother; how My brother had found the Water of Life, and had taken a cup full of the Water of Life; and how My brother had set a beautiful young lady free from a spell that bound a beautiful young lady; and how a beautiful young lady had engaged to wait a whole year, and then to marry My brother, and to give My brother his kingdom. Then they all three rode on together, and on they all three's way home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was feared all must die for want. But the eldest son gave the king of a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was feared all must die for want the bread, and all the king of the land's kingdom ate of the bread. And the eldest son lent the king of the land the wonderful sword, and the eldest son slew the enemy’s army with the wonderful sword; and thus all his kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner the eldest son befriended two other countries through which they all three passed on they all three's way. When they all three came to the sea, they all three got into a ship and during they all three's voyage the two eldest said to the two eldest, ‘the two eldest's has got the Water of Lifethe two eldest , therefore the two eldest's will forsake the two eldest and give My brother his kingdomthe two eldest's ’; so the two eldest were full of envy and revenge, and agreed together how the two eldest could ruin My brother. Then the two eldest waited till My brother was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of a cup full of it, and took a cup full of it for the two eldest, giving My brother bitter sea-water instead. When they all three came to they all three's journey’s end, the youngest son brought the youngest son's cup to My brother, that My brother might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however, had My brother tasted bitter sea-water when My brother became worse even than My brother was before; and then the two eldest came in, and blamed the youngest son for what the two eldest had done; and said that the eldest son wanted to poison the two eldest's , but that the two eldest had found the Water of Life, and had brought the Water of Life with the two eldest. the eldest son no sooner began to drink of what the two eldest brought the eldest son, than the eldest son felt their father’s sickness leave the eldest son, and was as strong and well as in the eldest son's younger days. Then the two eldest went to the two eldest's , and laughed at My brother, and said, ‘Well, My brother, My brother found the Water of Life, did My brother? My brother have had the trouble and the two eldest shall have the reward. Pray, with all My brother's cleverness, why did not My brother manage to keep My brother's eyes open? Next year one of the two eldest will take away a beautiful young lady, if My brother do not take care. My brother had better say nothing about this to the two eldest's , for a king who had three sons does not believe a word My brother say; and if My brother tell tales, My brother shall lose My brother's life into the bargain: but be quiet, and the two eldest will let My brother off.’ a king who had three sons was still very angry with the eldest son, and thought that a king who had three sons really meant to have taken away the eldest son's life; so a king who had three sons called a king who had three sons's court together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that the eldest son ought to be put to death. the eldest son knew nothing of what was going on, till one day, when a king who had three sons chief huntsmen went a-hunting with the eldest son, and they were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the eldest son said, ‘the huntsman, what is the matter with the huntsman?’ ‘the huntsman cannot and dare not tell the eldest son,’ said the huntsman. But the eldest son begged very hard, and said, ‘Only tell the eldest son what it is, and do not think the eldest son shall be angry, for the eldest son will forgive the huntsman.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘a king who had three sons has ordered the huntsman to shoot the eldest son.’ the eldest son started at ordered, and said, ‘Let the eldest son live, and the eldest son will change dresses with the huntsman; the huntsman shall take the eldest son's royal coat to show to the eldest son's , and do the huntsman give the eldest son the huntsman's shabby one.’ ‘With all the huntsman's heart,’ said the huntsman; ‘the huntsman am sure the huntsman shall be glad to save the eldest son, for the huntsman could not have shot the eldest son.’ Then the huntsman took my royal coat, and gave the eldest son your shabby one, and went away through the wood. Some time after, three grand embassies came to his court, with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for the eldest son; now all these were sent from the three kings to whom the huntsman had lent the huntsman's sword and loaf of bread, in order to rid the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of bread of the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of bread's enemy and feed the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of bread's people. This touched a king who had three sons's heart, and a king who had three sons thought the eldest son might still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that the eldest son were still alive! how it grieves a king who had three sons that a king who had three sons had the eldest son killed!’ ‘the eldest son is still alive,’ said the huntsman; ‘and the huntsman am glad that the huntsman had pity on the eldest son, but let the eldest son go in peace, and brought home my royal coat.’ At this a king who had three sons was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all a king who had three sons's kingdom, that if the eldest son would come back to his court a king who had three sons would forgive the eldest son. Meanwhile a beautiful young lady was eagerly waiting till a beautiful young lady's deliverer should come back; and had a road made leading up to a beautiful young lady's palace all of shining gold; and told a beautiful young lady's courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight up to the gate upon a road, was a beautiful young lady's true lover; and that her courtiers must let him in: but whoever rode on one side of a road, her courtiers must be sure was not the right one; and that her courtiers must send him away at once. The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that the eldest brother would make haste to go to a beautiful young lady, and say that the eldest brother was the one who had set a beautiful young lady free, and that the eldest brother should have a beautiful young lady for the eldest brother's wife, and his kingdom with a beautiful young lady. As the eldest brother came before the palace and saw a road, the eldest brother stopped to look at a road, and the eldest brother thought to the eldest brother, ‘It is a pity to ride upon a road’; so the eldest brother turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of a road. But when the eldest brother came to the iron door of the castle, the guards, who had seen a roadthe eldest brother , said to the eldest brother, the eldest brother could not be what the eldest brother said the eldest brother was, and must go about the eldest brother's business. The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when The second prince came to a road, and The second prince's horse had set one foot upon a road, The second prince stopped to look at a road, and thought a road very beautiful, and said to The second prince, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then The second prince turned aside and rode on the left side of a road. But when The second prince came to the iron door of the castle the guards, who had seen the road he took said The second prince was not the true prince, and that he too must go away about The second prince's business; and away The second prince went. Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest in which the eldest son had lain hid for fear of the eldest son's anger, and set out in search of a beautiful young lady. So the eldest son journeyed on, thinking of a beautiful young lady all the way, and rode so quickly that the eldest son did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over the road; and as the eldest son came to the gate the gate flew open, and a beautiful young lady welcomed the eldest son with joy, and said the eldest son was a beautiful young lady's deliverer, and should now be a beautiful young lady's husband and lord of his kingdom. When the first joy at they's meeting was over, a beautiful young lady told the eldest son a beautiful young lady had heard of the eldest son's having forgiven the eldest son, and of the eldest son's wish to have the eldest son home again: so, before the eldest son's wedding with a beautiful young lady, the eldest son went to visit the eldest son's , taking a beautiful young lady with the eldest son. Then the eldest son told a king who had three sons everything; how the eldest son's brothers had cheated and robbed the eldest son, and yet that the eldest son had borne all those wrongs for the love of the eldest son's . And a king who had three sons was very angry, and wanted to punish his brothers; but his brothers made his brothers's escape, and got into a ship and sailed away over the sea, and where his brothers went to nobody knew and nobody cared. And now a king who had three sons gathered together his court, and asked all a king who had three sons's kingdom to come and celebrate his wedding with the princess. And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.   And his wedding with the princess was held, and the merry bells run.   And all the good people all the good people danced and all the good people sung,   And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.","[[[19, 24], [26, 27], [38, 38], [42, 42], [49, 51], [86, 87],

52,THE TWELVE HUNTSMEN,"There was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end. Then he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go and leave you, I give you a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch you.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,’ and he named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes, dear father, your will shall be done,’ and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died. When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said: ‘Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.’ The father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,’ and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size. When they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said: ‘Yes,’ and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve huntsmen. The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he said to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the king, ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ‘You are mistaken, they are twelve girls.’ The king said: ‘That cannot be true! How will you prove that to me?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will soon see. Men have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.’ The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn. There was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion wants to make the king believe that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens: ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.’ So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like men.’ The lion said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’ The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber. But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter said to her eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round at the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion: ‘You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ‘They have restrained themselves.’ The king, however, would no longer believe the lion. The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.","There was once a king’s son who had a bride whom a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much loved very much. And when a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much was sitting beside a bride whom he loved very much and very happy, news came that a king’s lay sick unto death, and desired to see a king’s once again before a king’s's end.

When a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much am king, a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much will return and fetch a bride whom he loved very much.’ So a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much rode away, and when a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much reached a king’s, a king’s was dangerously ill, and near a king’s's death. a king’s said to a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much: ‘a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much, a king’s wished to see a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much once again before his end, promise a king’s to marry as a king’s wish,’ and a king’s named a certain king’s daughter who was to be a king’s's wife. a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much was in such trouble that a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much did not think what a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much was doing, and said: ‘Yes, a king’s, a king’s's will shall be done,’ and thereupon a king’s shut a king’s's eyes, and died.

Thereupon a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife took a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife's leave of a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife's , and rode away with they, and rode to the court of a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife's a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife . Then a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife asked if a king’s required any huntsmen, and if a king’s would take any huntsmen any huntsmen into a king’s's service. a king’s looked at a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife and did not know a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife, but as any huntsmen were such handsome fellows, a king’s said: ‘Yes,’ and that a king’s would willingly take any huntsmen, and now any huntsmen were a king’s twelve huntsmen. a king’s, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things knew all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things said to a king’s: ‘a king’s think a king’s have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said a king’s, ‘twelve huntsmen are twelve huntsmen.’ a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things continued: ‘a king’s are mistaken, twelve huntsmen are twelve girls.’ a king’s said: ‘are cannot be true! How will a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things prove are to a king’s?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber,’ answered a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things, ‘and then a king’s will soon see. Men have a firm step, and when Men walk over peas none of Men stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag girls's feet, and peas roll about.’ a king’s was well pleased with the counsel, and caused some peas to be strewn. There was, however, a servant of a king’s who favoured twelve huntsmen, and when a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen heard that twelve huntsmen were going to be put to this test a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen went to twelve huntsmen and repeated everything, and said: ‘a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things wants to make a king’s believe that twelve huntsmen are girls.’ Then a king’s's daughter thanked a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen, and said to the king’s daughter's : ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on some peas.’ So next morning when a king’s had twelve huntsmen called before a king’s, and twelve huntsmen came into the ante-chamber, twelve huntsmen stepped so firmly on some peas, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of some peas either rolled or stirred. Then twelve huntsmen went away again, and a king’s said to a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things: ‘a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things have lied to a king’s, twelve huntsmen walk just like men.’ a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things said: ‘twelve huntsmen have been informed that twelve huntsmen were going to be put to this test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and twelve spinning-wheels will go to twelve huntsmen and be pleased with twelve huntsmen, and that is what no man would do.’ a king’s liked the advice, and had twelve spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber. But a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen, went to twelve huntsmen, and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter said to the king’s daughter's eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round at twelve spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when a king’s had twelve huntsmen summoned, twelve huntsmen went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at twelve spinning-wheels. Then a king’s again said to a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things: ‘a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things have deceived a king’s, twelve huntsmen are men, for twelve huntsmen have not looked at twelve spinning-wheels.’ a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things replied: ‘twelve huntsmen have restrained twelve huntsmen.’ a king’s, however, would no longer believe a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things. twelve huntsmen always followed a king’s to the chase, and a king’s's liking for twelve huntsmen continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting, news came that a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife was approaching. When a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife heard was, was hurt a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife so much that a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife's heart was almost broken, and a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife fell fainting to the ground. a king’s thought something had happened to a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen, ran up to a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen, wanted to help a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen, and drew a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen's glove off. Then a king’s saw a ring, and when a king’s looked in a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife's face a king’s recognized a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. Then her heart was so touched that a king’s kissed a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife, and when a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife opened a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife's eyes a king’s said: ‘a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife are a king’s, and a king’s am a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife, and no one in the world can alter that.’ a king’s sent a messenger to a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife, and entreated a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife to return to a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife's own kingdom, for a king’s had a wife already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things was again taken into favour, because, after all, a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things had told the truth.","[[[3, 15], [12, 12], [19, 19], [31, 31], [50, 50], [53, 53], [57, 57], [65, 65], [74, 74], [77, 77], [81, 81], [90, 90], [96, 96], [98, 98], [115, 115], [118, 119], [125, 125], [156, 157], [163, 163], [168, 168], [201, 202], [216, 216], [224, 224], [227, 227], [247, 247], [249, 249], [261, 261]], [[9, 15], [23, 23], [53, 54], [63, 63], [67, 67], [86, 86]], [[3, 5], [31, 32], [42, 42], [46, 46], [98, 99], [101, 102], [109, 109], [112, 112], [121, 121], [129, 129], [133, 133], [137, 137], [142, 142], [153, 153], [178, 179], [181, 181], [190, 191], [193, 193], [227, 228], [232, 234], [269, 270], [302, 303], [322, 323], [340, 340], [348, 348], [361, 361], [375, 377], [421, 422], [436, 444], [450, 450], [457, 457], [464, 464], [467, 468], [486, 486], [495, 495], [505, 507], [511, 512], [544, 545], [548, 548], [550, 550], [561, 562], [576, 576], [586, 587], [603, 603], [629, 629], [669, 670], [694, 696], [733, 734], [743, 745], [773, 774], [781, 781], [831, 832], [843, 843], [914, 915], [959, 960], [959, 961], [990, 991], [993, 993], [1017, 1018], [1029, 1029], [1058, 1059], [1075, 1076], [1082, 1082], [1105, 1107], [1139, 1140], [1146, 1146], [1167, 1167], [1172, 1172], [1176, 1176], [1182, 1182], [1187, 1187], [1192, 1192], [1198, 1198], [1208, 1208], [1214, 1214], [1217, 1217], [1232, 1232], [1252, 1252]], [[46, 47], [129, 130]], [[144, 154], [232, 235], [243, 243], [249, 251], [264, 264], [269, 269], [273, 273], [276, 277], [281, 281], [285, 285], [289, 289], [293, 293], [305, 305], [312, 312], [332, 332], [361, 362], [375, 378], [380, 380], [407, 408], [408, 408], [416, 416], [418, 418], [421, 421], [436, 436], [441, 441], [447, 447], [471, 471], [476, 476], [1105, 1108], [1113, 1115], [1121, 1121], [1125, 1125], [1132, 1132], [1176, 1178], [1185, 1185], [1189, 1189], [1200, 1200], [1204, 1204], [1206, 1206], [1212, 1212], [1219, 1219], [1237, 1239], [1243, 1243], [1247, 1247]], [[306, 306], [332, 333]], [[308, 319], [394, 396]], [[382, 387], [401, 403], [401, 404]], [[372, 372], [428, 428]], [[452, 453], [460, 462], [462, 462], [480, 480], [499, 499], [503, 503]], [[517, 532], [526, 526], [541, 541], [571, 572], [599, 599], [623, 624], [728, 729], [835, 836], [839, 839], [852, 853], [1022, 1023], [1026, 1026], [1047, 1048], [1067, 1068], [1281, 1282], [1294, 1294]], [[552, 553], [565, 565], [580, 580], [699, 700], [707, 707], [719, 719], [737, 737], [753, 754], [776, 778], [784, 784], [797, 797], [825, 825], [845, 845], [857, 857], [862, 862], [897, 897], [902, 902], [942, 943], [947, 947], [993, 995], [998, 998], [1031, 1031], [1036, 1036], [1052, 1052], [1055, 1055], [1070, 1072], [1085, 1085]], [[581, 581], [591, 591], [601, 601]], [[634, 634], [642, 642], [648, 648]], [[652, 652], [659, 659]], [[645, 645], [663, 664]], [[611, 612], [680, 681], [765, 766], [792, 793], [802, 802], [817, 818]], [[691, 700], [704, 704], [716, 716], [748, 748], [934, 943], [1146, 1148], [1153, 1153], [1158, 1158], [1162, 1162]], [[743, 746], [753, 753], [959, 962], [965, 965]], [[616, 619], [787, 795], [887, 890], [928, 931], [1001, 1004]], [[714, 715], [869, 870]], [[880, 883], [893, 893], [922, 925], [980, 983], [1011, 1014], [1041, 1044]], [[1109, 1109], [1117, 1117], [1119, 1119]], [[68, 69], [1169, 1178]], [[1125, 1126], [1192, 1193]]]"
53,THE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN,"There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble. One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the merchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ‘Who knows but I may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’ said the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him. But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in. About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before. Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel said, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be too much for the little man.’ When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him. ‘Have you brought me what you said you would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to talk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my father,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and softly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said Heinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company. So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge. The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said he to himself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers. Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour. They will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do what they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The second night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life and health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain. They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was against his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take this ring, and put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s house.’ Then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived. Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father’s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your son?’ ‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm.’ Then he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he had said was true. He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant said, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels about in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him. One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat himself down, and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen asleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger. ‘I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he; ‘they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my kingdom.’ So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three giants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass they cried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods between us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever the wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a moment he was a fly. ‘The cloak is very well,’ said he: ‘now give me the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless you undertake not to say, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’ So they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about. As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and cup were always empty. Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’ said she to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still seem to bind me?’ ‘False and fickle one!’ said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee free, and he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to have had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him. However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he drew his sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried he; and with the word the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king of the Golden Mountain.","There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had two richly laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas, in which a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had embarked all a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's wealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that two richly laden ships were lost. Thus from being a rich man a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone but one small plot of land; and there a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone often went in an evening to take a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's walk, and ease a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's mind of a little of a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's trouble. One day, as a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had been and what a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. ‘Prithee, Prithee, why so sorrowful?’ said a little, rough-looking, black dwarf to a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; ‘what is it a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If a little, rough-looking, black dwarf would do a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone any good a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone would willingly tell a little, rough-looking, black dwarf,’ said a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. ‘Who knows but a little, rough-looking, black dwarf may?’ said a little, rough-looking, black dwarf: ‘tell a little, rough-looking, black dwarf what ails a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and perhaps a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone will find a little, rough-looking, black dwarf may be of some use.’ Then a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone told a little, rough-looking, black dwarf how all a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's wealth was gone to the bottom of the seas, and how a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had nothing left but one small plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone about that,’ said a little, rough-looking, black dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring a little, rough-looking, black dwarf here, twelve years hence, whatever meets a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone first on a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's going home, and a little, rough-looking, black dwarf will give a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone as much as a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone please.’ a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's dog or a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's cat, or something of that sort, but forgot only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; so a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. But as a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone drew near home, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was so glad to see a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone that only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone crept behind a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and laid fast hold of a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's legs, and looked up in a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's face and laughed. Then a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had bound a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone to do; but as no gold was come, a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone made a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone easy by thinking that it was only a joke that a little, rough-looking, black dwarf was playing a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and that, at any rate, when the money came, a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone should see the bearer, and would not take the money in. About a month afterwards a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone might sell some old iron and raise a little money; and there, instead of some old iron, a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. At the sight of a large pile of gold lying on the floor a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was overjoyed, and forgetting all about only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before. Meantime only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone began to call to mind a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's face. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone one day asked what was the matter, but only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's would not tell for some time; at last, however, a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said that a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had, without knowing it, it only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone for gold to a little, rough-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone must keep a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's word. Then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said, ‘a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, give a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone very little trouble about that; only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone shall be too much for only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone.’ When the time came, the father and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone went out together to the place agreed upon: and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone drew a circle on the ground, and set the father and son in the middle of a circle. a little, rough-looking, black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about a circle, but could not find any way to get into a circle, and a little, rough-looking, black dwarf either could not, or dared not, jump over a circle. At last only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said to a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. ‘Have a little, rough-looking, black dwarf anything to say to the father and son, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's , or what do a little, rough-looking, black dwarf want?’ Now only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and had told only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone what to do; for a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do knew what good luck was in store for only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. ‘Have a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone brought a little, rough-looking, black dwarf what a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone would?’ said a little, rough-looking, black dwarf to a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone held a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's tongue, but only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said again, ‘What do a little, rough-looking, black dwarf want here?’ a little, rough-looking, black dwarf said, ‘a little, rough-looking, black dwarf come to talk with only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's , not with only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone.’ ‘a little, rough-looking, black dwarf have cheated and taken in only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's ,’ said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; ‘pray give a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and softly,’ said a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; ‘right is right; a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone have paid a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's money, and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's has had my money, and spent my money; so be so good as to let a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone have what a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone paid my money for.’ ‘a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone must have a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's consent to let first,’ said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, ‘so please to step in here, and let the father and son talk it over.’ a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone grinned, and showed a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's teeth, as if a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone should have been very glad to get into a circle if a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone could. Then at last, after a long talk, the father and son came to terms. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone agreed that only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's must give only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone up, and that so far a little, rough-looking, black dwarf should have a little, rough-looking, black dwarf's way: but, on the other hand, a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do had told only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone what fortune was in store for only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, if only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone followed only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's own course; and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone did not choose to be given up to only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's company. So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone should push only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone off with a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's own hand, and that only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather. Then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone took leave of only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's , and set only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone in an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by, but before an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by got far off a wave struck an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by, and an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by fell with one side low in the water, so a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone thought that only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while a little, rough-looking, black dwarf went a little, rough-looking, black dwarf's way, thinking that at any rate a little, rough-looking, black dwarf had had a little, rough-looking, black dwarf's revenge. an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by, however, did not sink, for a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do took care of a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do's , and soon raised an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by up again, and an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by went safely on. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone sat safe within, till at length an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by ran ashore upon an unknown land. As only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone jumped upon the shore only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone saw before only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone to only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, ‘must only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone find the prize a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do told only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone of.’ So only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone once more searched the whole palace through, till at last only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers. Now a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do was an enchanted princess; and a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do was very glad to see only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and said, ‘Are only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone at last come to set a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do free? Twelve long years have a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do waited here for a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do to bring only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone hither as a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do promised, for only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone can save a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do. This night twelve men will come: twelve men's faces will be black, and twelve men will be dressed in chain armour. twelve men will ask what only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone do here, but give no answer; and let twelve men do what twelve men will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone--bear all; only speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock twelve men must go away. The second night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who will even cut off only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's head; but at the twelfth hour of the third night twelve men's power is gone, and a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do shall be free, and will come and bring only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone the Water of Life, and will wash only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone with the Water of Life, and bring only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone back to life and health.’ And all came to pass as a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do had said; only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do came, and fell on only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's neck and kissed only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was crowned king of the Golden Mountain. the father and son lived together very happily, and a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do had a son. And thus eight years had passed over the father and son's heads, when only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone thought of only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's ; and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone began to long to see a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone once again. But a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do was against only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's going, and said, ‘a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do know well that misfortunes will come upon the father and son if only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone go.’ However, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone gave a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do no rest till a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do agreed. At only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's going away a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do gave only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take a wishing-ring, and put a wishing-ring on only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's finger; whatever only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone wish a wishing-ring will bring only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; only promise never to make use of a wishing-ring to bring a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do hence to only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's house.’ Then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone would do what a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do asked, and put a wishing-ring on your finger, and wished only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone near the town where only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's lived. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone found only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not let only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone go in, because only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was so strangely clad. So only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed a shepherd's old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town where his father lived. When only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone came to your father’s house, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's son; but the merchant would not believe only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and said the merchant had had but one son, the merchant's poor Heinel, who the merchant knew was long since dead: and as only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was only dressed like a shepherd, the merchant would not even give only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone anything to eat. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, however, still vowed that only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which the merchant would know only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone if only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone am really the merchant's son?’ ‘Yes,’ said a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do, ‘the father and son's had a mark like a raspberry on only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's right arm.’ Then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone showed the merchant a mark like a raspberry, and the merchant knew that what only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had said was true. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone next told the merchant how only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was king of the Golden Mountain, and was married to a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do, and had a son. But a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said, ‘that can never be true; only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone must be a fine king truly who travels about in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was vexed; and forgetting only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's word, turned a wishing-ring, and wished for the father and son. In an instant the father and son stood before only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; but a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do wept, and said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had broken only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's word, and bad luck would follow. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone did all only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone could to soothe a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do, and a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do at last seemed to be appeased; but a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do was not so in truth, and was only thinking how a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do should punish only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. One day only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone took a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do to walk with only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone out of the town where his father lived, and showed a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do the spot where an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone sat only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone down, and said, ‘only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone am very much tired; sit by only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone will rest only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's head in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do's lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had fallen asleep, however, a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do drew a wishing-ring from your finger, and crept softly away, and wished a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do's at home in the father and son's kingdom. And when only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone awoke only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone found only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone alone, and saw that a wishing-ring was gone from your finger. ‘only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone can never go back to your father’s house,’ said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; ‘they would say only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone am a sorcerer: only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone will journey forth into the world, till only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone come again to their kingdom.’ So saying only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone set out and travelled till only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone came to a hill, where three giants were sharing three giants's goods; and as three giants saw only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone pass three giants cried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone shall part their father’s goods between three giants.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever the wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave the owner any form the owner pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever the wearer wished. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone said they must first let only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone try these wonderful things, then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone might know how to set a value upon these wonderful things. Then they gave only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone the cloak, and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone wished only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone a fly, and in a moment only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was a fly. ‘the cloak is very well,’ said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone: ‘now give only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone undertake not to say, “Heads off!” for if only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone do they are all dead men.’ So they gave the sword only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, charging only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone to try the sword on a tree. only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone next asked for the boots also; and the moment only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone had all three in only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's power, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone wished only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone at the Golden Mountain; and there only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was at once. So three giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about. As only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone came near only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone's castle only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone heard the sound of merry music; and the people around told only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone that a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do was about to marry another husband. Then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone threw the cloak around only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and passed through the castle hall, and placed only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone by the side of a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do, where no one saw only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. But when anything to eat was put upon a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do's plate, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone took anything to eat away and ate anything to eat only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; and when a glass of wine was handed to a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone took a glass of wine and drank a glass of wine; and thus, though they kept on giving a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do's meat and drink, a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do's plate and cup were always empty. Upon this, fear and remorse came over a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do, and a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do went into a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do's chamber alone, and sat there weeping; and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone followed a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do there. ‘Alas!’ said a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do to a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do, ‘was a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still seem to bind a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do?’ ‘False and fickle one!’ said only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. ‘One indeed came who set a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do free, and One is now near a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do again; but how have a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do used One? Ought One to have had such treatment from a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do?’ Then only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone went out and sent away the company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was come back to their kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. However, only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone would enter into no parley with the princes, peers, and great men, but only asked the princes, peers, and great men if the princes, peers, and great men would go in peace or not. Then the princes, peers, and great men turned upon only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone and tried to seize only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; but only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone drew the sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone; and with the word the princes, peers, and great men's heads fell before only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone, and only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone was once more king of the Golden Mountain.","[[[3, 24], [26, 26], [42, 42], [46, 46], [72, 72], [85, 85], [95, 95], [103, 103], [108, 108], [114, 114], [121, 121], [137,

54,DOCTOR KNOWALL,"There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor, ‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete, that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he knows it; he must also know who has the money!’ On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.","There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold a load of wood to a doctor for two talers. When two talers was being counted out to a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, it so happened that a doctor was sitting at table, and when a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town saw how well a doctor ate and drank, a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town's heart desired what a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too. So a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said a doctor, ‘inquired is soon managed.’ ‘What must a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town do?’ asked a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town. ‘In the first place buy a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second, turn a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town's cart and two oxen into money, and get a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town with the words: “a doctor am Doctor Knowall,” and have a sign nailed up above a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town's house-door.’ a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town did everything that a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town had been told to do. When a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then a rich and great lord was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of some money. So a rich and great lord had the horses harnessed to a rich and great lord's carriage, drove out to the village, and asked a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town if a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town were a doctor. Yes, a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town was, a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town said. Then a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town was to go with a rich and great lord and bring back some money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town's wife, must go too.’ a rich and great lord was willing, and let both of them have a seat in his carriage, and both of them drove away together. When both of them came to a rich and great lord's castle, the table was spread, and a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town was told to sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but Grete, my wife, too,’ said a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town seated a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town with Grete, my wife at the table. And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town nudged Grete, my wife, and said: ‘Grete, my wife, the first servant was the first,’ meaning the first servant was the first servanta dish of delicate fare. the first servant, however, thought the first servant intended by that to say: ‘a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town is the first thief,’ and as the first servant actually was so, the first servant was terrified, and said to the first servant's comrade outside: ‘a doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, a doctor said the first servant was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when The second went in with The second's dish, the first servant nudged the first servant's , and said: ‘Grete, my wife, his dish is the second.’ The second was equally alarmed, and The second got out as fast as The second could. The third fared no better, for the first servant again said: ‘Grete, my wife, his dish is The third.’ The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and a rich and great lord told a doctor that a doctor was to show a doctor's skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there were crabs. a doctor looked at a dish that was covered, had no idea what to say, and cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When a rich and great lord heard that, a rich and great lord cried: ‘There! a doctor knows it; a doctor must also know who has some money!’ On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to a doctor that the servants wished a doctor to step outside for a moment. When therefore a doctor went out, the servants confessed to a doctor that the servants had stolen some money, and said that the servants would willingly restore some money and give a doctor a heavy sum into the bargain, if a doctor would not denounce the servants, for if a doctor did the servants would be hanged. the servants led a doctor to the spot where some money was concealed. With this a doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said: ‘a rich and great lord, now will a doctor search in a doctor's book where some money is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if a doctor knew still more. But a doctor sat still and opened my book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As a doctor could not find the cock immediately a doctor said: ‘a doctor know The fifth servant are there, so The fifth servant had better come out!’ Then The fifth servant the stove thought that a doctor meant The fifth servant, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: ‘a doctor knows everything!’ Then a doctor showed a rich and great lord where some money was, but did not say who had stolen some money, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.","[[[17, 20], [27, 27]], [[32, 33], [36, 37]], [[6, 23], [43, 43], [58, 59], [68, 68], [72, 72], [85, 85], [124, 124], [129, 130], [138, 138], [160, 160], [163, 163], [171, 171], [189, 189], [207, 207], [213, 214], [218, 218], [226, 226], [291, 291], [293, 293], [300, 300], [303, 303], [307, 307], [328, 328], [375, 375], [388, 388], [397, 397], [400, 400], [402, 402], [422, 423], [425, 425], [465, 465]], [[29, 30], [49, 50], [63, 63], [111, 112], [195, 195], [295, 296], [491, 492], [501, 501], [604, 605], [607, 607], [611, 611], [628, 629], [664, 664], [668, 668], [691, 692], [696, 696], [706, 706], [716, 716], [734, 734], [743, 743], [751, 751], [760, 760], [772, 773], [793, 793], [798, 798], [801, 801], [823, 824], [830, 831], [836, 836], [856, 856], [862, 862], [866, 866], [888, 889], [904, 905], [911, 912]], [[94, 94], [115, 115]], [[15, 16], [163, 165]], [[185, 186], [203, 203]], [[236, 240], [247, 247], [273, 274], [280, 280], [312, 312], [336, 337], [364, 366], [601, 602], [653, 654], [658, 658], [793, 794], [914, 915]], [[242, 243], [269, 270], [316, 318], [674, 675], [721, 722], [731, 731], [765, 766], [804, 805], [917, 918], [928, 928]], [[280, 281], [350, 351]], [[343, 345], [354, 355], [361, 361]], [[326, 329], [388, 391], [404, 404], [425, 426], [432, 432], [536, 537], [543, 543], [580, 580]], [[369, 370], [406, 407]], [[411, 413], [434, 434], [441, 441], [443, 449], [451, 452], [457, 457], [474, 474], [479, 479], [486, 486], [503, 503], [533, 534], [536, 536], [574, 575]], [[416, 420], [447, 449]], [[509, 510], [526, 526], [530, 530], [551, 552], [558, 558], [564, 564]], [[530, 531], [545, 545], [582, 582]], [[567, 568], [584, 585]], [[594, 598], [632, 633]], [[680, 681], [694, 694], [710, 713], [718, 718], [727, 727], [747, 747], [753, 753], [758, 758]], [[801, 802], [836, 840]], [[852, 853], [860, 860]], [[810, 812], [868, 868], [873, 873], [881, 885], [891, 891]], [[818, 819], [884, 885]]]"
55,THE SEVEN RAVENS,"There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter. Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be christened. So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful. For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her. She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood, rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done? She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it. As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she. Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass. On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other, ‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my little glass?’  ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween   Mortal lips have this way been.’ When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s, and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home.","There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.

Caw! well I ween   Mortal lips have this way been.’ When the seventh came to the bottom of the seventh's glass, and found there a little ring which her father and mother had given her, the seventh looked at a little ring which her father and mother had given her, and knew that a little ring which her father and mother had given her was the seventh's father’s and mother’s, and said, ‘O that his father’s and mother’s's would but come! then his father’s and mother’s should be free.’ When one daughter heard this (for one daughter stood behind the door all the time and listened), one daughter ran forward, and in an instant seven sons took seven sons's right form again; and seven sons hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home.","[[[14, 15], [18, 20], [25, 25], [34, 34], [42, 42], [267, 280], [286, 286], [291, 291], [299, 299], [311, 311], [318, 318], [323, 323], [336, 336], [348, 348], [355, 355], [360, 360], [368, 368], [376, 376], [397, 397], [410, 410], [421, 423], [433, 433], [438, 438], [442, 442], [447, 447], [459, 459], [472, 472], [488, 488], [490, 490], [494, 494], [500, 500], [506, 506], [514, 514], [526, 526], [539, 539], [545, 545], [554, 554], [563, 563], [580, 580], [610, 610], [612, 612], [631, 631], [651, 651], [663, 663], [672, 672], [688, 688], [693, 695], [715, 715], [730, 730], [741, 741], [751, 751], [753, 753], [769, 769], [773, 773], [790, 793], [799, 799], [804, 804], [818, 818], [833, 833], [843, 843], [851, 851], [857, 857], [860, 860], [869, 869], [886, 886], [939, 940], [952, 952], [959, 959], [964, 964], [968, 968], [978, 978], [1107, 1109], [1122, 1124], [1129, 1129], [1141, 1141]], [[32, 32], [40, 40]], [[3, 8], [50, 51], [55, 55], [130, 131], [153, 153], [172, 172], [184, 184], [199, 199], [204, 204], [209, 209], [230, 230], [234, 234], [239, 239], [253, 253], [257, 257], [263, 263], [267, 267]], [[7, 8], [55, 56], [263, 265], [309, 309], [326, 326], [348, 349], [386, 386], [442, 443], [472, 473], [476, 476], [482, 482], [688, 689], [773, 774], [860, 865], [877, 878], [890, 890], [996, 997], [1001, 1001], [1005, 1005], [1015, 1015], [1149, 1151], [1153, 1153], [1159, 1159]], [[53, 56], [73, 73]], [[64, 65], [82, 83]], [[68, 70], [87, 87], [94, 94], [96, 96], [104, 104], [141, 143], [156, 158], [162, 162], [178, 178], [191, 192]], [[320, 323], [333, 333]], [[299, 302], [368, 371], [389, 389], [500, 503]], [[403, 406], [418, 418]], [[566, 567], [570, 571]], [[585, 586], [589, 590], [600, 600]], [[620, 621], [624, 625], [759, 761]], [[634, 635], [638, 638]], [[652, 656], [666, 670], [697, 700], [703, 703], [733, 737], [745, 745], [814, 820]], [[681, 684], [718, 721], [781, 787], [784, 787]], [[706, 708], [743, 744]], [[804, 820], [824, 824]], [[725, 726], [826, 827], [830, 830], [1132, 1133]], [[837, 839], [872, 873], [877, 877], [899, 901], [909, 909], [989, 990], [996, 996]], [[904, 904], [911, 911], [919, 919], [939, 939]], [[914, 924], [928, 928]], [[496, 506], [961, 968], [1081, 1082], [1087, 1087], [1092, 1092]], [[1023, 1023], [1033, 1033], [1044, 1044]], [[1068, 1069], [1075, 1075], [1084, 1084], [1094, 1094]], [[1094, 1099], [1107, 1107], [1115, 1115]]]"
56,THE WEDDING OF MRS FOX," FIRST STORY There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves. The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:  ‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?   Do you sleep or do you wake?’ She answered:  ‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,   Would you know what I am making?   I am boiling warm beer with butter,   Will you be my guest for supper?’ ‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid replied:  ‘She is sitting in her room,   Moaning in her gloom,   Weeping her little eyes quite red,   Because old Mr Fox is dead.’ ‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’   The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,   The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,  ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’  ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.  ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’  ‘What does he look like, my dear?’ ‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’ Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:  ‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,   And carry old Mr Fox outside.’ But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs Fox out of the house. SECOND STORY When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The wolf greeted her, and said:  ‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,   How comes it that alone you sit?   What are you making good?’ The cat replied:  ‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,   Will you be my guest, and eat?’ ‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’ The cat said:  ‘She sits upstairs in her room,   Bewailing her sorrowful doom,   Bewailing her trouble so sore,   For old Mr Fox is no more.’ The wolf answered:  ‘If she’s in want of a husband now,   Then will it please her to step below?’   The cat runs quickly up the stair,   And lets her tail fly here and there,   Until she comes to the parlour door.   With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:  ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?   If you’re in want of a husband now,   Then will it please you to step below? Mrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed mouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’ When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come upstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.  ‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,   Up with the window, fling out my old man!   For many a fine fat mouse he brought,   Yet of his wife he never thought,   But ate up every one he caught.’ Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still."," FIRST STORY There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test's wife was not faithful to an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test, and wished to put his wife to the test. an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test stretched an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test were stone dead. his wife went up to his wife's room, shut his wife in, and his wife's maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking.

57,THE SALAD,"As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood, there came up a little old woman, and said to him, ‘Good day, good day; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me something to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, ‘Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It is the bird’s heart that will bring you this good luck.’ The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ‘If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself. ‘Well,’ said the huntsman, ‘this is wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot into the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the flock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it. Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him. The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and at last thought to himself, ‘Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am at home? I will go out into the world and look about me.’ Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his neck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and said to the young lady, ‘There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird’s heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.’ Meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, ‘I have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want’; but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady’s eyes, and doing everything that she wished. Then the old woman said, ‘Now is the time for getting the bird’s heart.’ So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady’s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize. ‘Well,’ said the old witch, ‘we have got the bird’s heart, but not the wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ‘Let us leave him that,’ said the young lady; ‘he has already lost his wealth.’ Then the witch was very angry, and said, ‘Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old woman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ‘What makes you so sad?’ ‘Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ‘yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot.’ ‘If that’s all your grief,’ said the huntsman, ‘I’ll take you there with all my heart’; so he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, ‘Let us sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand any longer.’ So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself home again. When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, ‘Alas! what roguery there is in the world!’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ‘I can only save myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed him with his foot, and said, ‘What worm is this that lies here curled up?’ ‘Tread upon him and kill him,’ said the second. ‘It’s not worth the trouble,’ said the third; ‘let him live, he’ll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.’ And they passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they were gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat there a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden, and he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages. Then he looked around him, and said, ‘I wish I had something to eat, if not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last he thought to himself, ‘I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen me.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with horror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again. Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad, and thought to himself, ‘This will help me to my fortune again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.’ So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over brown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; ‘I am so tired,’ said he, ‘that I can go no farther.’ ‘Countryman,’ said the witch, ‘who are you? and what is your business?’ ‘I am,’ said he, ‘a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don’t know that I can carry it farther.’ When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they longed to taste it, and said, ‘Dear countryman, let us just taste it.’ ‘To be sure,’ answered he; ‘I have two heads of it with me, and will give you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ‘I don’t know where the salad can be.’ Then he thought something must have happened, and said, ‘I will go into the kitchen and see.’ And as he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the ground. ‘All right!’ said he; ‘those two have had their share.’ Then he took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady, saying, ‘I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.’ So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying away. Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him. ‘Now you shall be paid for your roguery,’ said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window. ‘What’s the matter?’ said the miller. ‘I have three tiresome beasts here,’ said the other; ‘if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever you ask.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the miller; ‘but how shall I treat them?’ Then the huntsman said, ‘Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes’: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten. After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he wanted. Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was dead; ‘The other two,’ said he, ‘are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful that they cannot last long.’ Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, ‘O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the bird’s heart, I will give it you too.’ But he said, ‘Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean to make you my wife.’ So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.","As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood, there came up a little old woman, and said to a merry young huntsman, ‘Good day, good day; a merry young huntsman seem merry enough, but a little old woman am hungry and thirsty; do pray give a little old woman something to eat.’ a merry young huntsman took pity on a little old woman, and put a merry young huntsman's hand in a merry young huntsman's pocket and gave a little old woman what a merry young huntsman had. Then a merry young huntsman wanted to go a merry young huntsman's way; but a little old woman took hold of a merry young huntsman, and said, ‘Listen, a little old woman's , to what a little old woman am going to tell a merry young huntsman; a little old woman will reward a merry young huntsman for a merry young huntsman's kindness; go a merry young huntsman's way, and after a little time a merry young huntsman will come to a tree where a merry young huntsman will see nine birds sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of nine birds, and one will fall down dead: a cloak will fall too; take a cloak, a cloak is a wishing-cloak, and when a merry young huntsman wear a cloak a merry young huntsman will find a merry young huntsman at any place where a merry young huntsman may wish to be. Cut open one, take out one's heart and keep its heart, and a merry young huntsman will find a piece of gold under a merry young huntsman's pillow every morning when a merry young huntsman rise. It is its heart that will bring a merry young huntsman this good luck.’ a merry young huntsman thanked a little old woman, and thought to a merry young huntsman, ‘If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for a merry young huntsman.’ When a merry young huntsman had gone a hundred steps or so, a merry young huntsman heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over a merry young huntsman, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with a flock of birds's bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have a cloak each. ‘Well,’ said a merry young huntsman, ‘this is wonderful; this happens just as a little old woman said’; then a merry young huntsman shot into the midst of them so that a flock of birds's feathers flew all about. Off went a flock of birds chattering away; but one fell down dead, and a cloak with one. Then a merry young huntsman did as a little old woman told a merry young huntsman, cut open one, took out its heart, and carried a cloak home with a merry young huntsman. The next morning when a merry young huntsman awoke a merry young huntsman lifted up a merry young huntsman's pillow, and there lay a piece of gold; the same happened next day, and indeed every day when a merry young huntsman arose. a merry young huntsman heaped up a great deal of gold, and at last thought to a merry young huntsman, ‘Of what use is a great deal of gold to a merry young huntsman whilst a merry young huntsman am at home? a merry young huntsman will go out into the world and look about a merry young huntsman.’ Then a merry young huntsman took leave of a merry young huntsman's friends, and hung a merry young huntsman's bag and bow about a merry young huntsman's neck, and went a merry young huntsman's way. It so happened that a merry young huntsman's road one day led through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and at one of the windows stood a little old woman with a very beautiful young lady by a little old woman's side looking about them. Now a little old woman was a witch, and said to a very beautiful young lady, ‘There is a merry young huntsmana wood ; we must get a wonderful prize away from a merry young huntsman, a very beautiful young lady, for a wonderful prize is more fit for we than for a merry young huntsman. a merry young huntsman has a bird’s heart that brings a piece of gold under a merry young huntsman's pillow every morning.’ Meantime a merry young huntsman came nearer and looked at a little old woman, and said to a merry young huntsman, ‘a merry young huntsman have been travelling so long that a merry young huntsman should like to go into a large castle and rest a merry young huntsman, for a merry young huntsman have money enough to pay for anything a merry young huntsman want’; but the real reason was, that a merry young huntsman wanted to see more of a little old woman. Then a merry young huntsman went into a large castle, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before a merry young huntsman was so much in love that a merry young huntsman thought of nothing else but looking at a little old woman's eyes, and doing everything that a little old woman wished. Then a little old woman said, ‘Now is the time for getting its heart.’ So a little old woman stole its heart away, and a merry young huntsman never found any more gold under his pillow, for its heart lay now under a little old woman, and a little old woman took its heart away every morning; but a merry young huntsman was so much in love that a merry young huntsman never missed a wonderful prize. ‘Well,’ said a little old woman, ‘we have got its heart, but not the wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ‘Let we leave a merry young huntsman the wishing-cloak,’ said a very beautiful young lady; ‘a merry young huntsman has already lost a merry young huntsman's wealth.’ Then a little old woman was very angry, and said, ‘Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing, and a little old woman must and will have Such a cloak.’ So a little old woman did as a little old woman told a little old woman, and set a little old woman at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then a merry young huntsman said, ‘What makes a little old woman so sad?’ ‘Alas! a merry young huntsman,’ said a little old woman, ‘yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and a little old woman want so much to go there, that whenever a little old woman think of the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow a little old woman cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow? only the birds and the flies--man cannot.’ ‘If that’s all a little old woman's grief,’ said a merry young huntsman, ‘a merry young huntsman’ll take a very beautiful young lady there with all a merry young huntsman's heart’; so a merry young huntsman drew a very beautiful young lady under a merry young huntsman's cloak, and the moment a merry young huntsman wished to be on the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow they were both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But a little old woman made a deep sleep come upon a merry young huntsman, and a merry young huntsman said to a very beautiful young lady, ‘Let they sit down and rest they a little, a merry young huntsman am so tired that a merry young huntsman cannot stand any longer.’ So they sat down, and a merry young huntsman laid a merry young huntsman's head in a very beautiful young lady's lap and fell asleep; and whilst a merry young huntsman was sleeping on a very beautiful young lady took his cloak from a merry young huntsman's shoulders, hung his cloak on a very beautiful young lady's own, picked up The diamonds, and wished a very beautiful young lady home again. When a merry young huntsman awoke and found that a little old woman had tricked a merry young huntsman, and left a merry young huntsman alone on the wild rock, a merry young huntsman said, ‘Alas! what roguery there is in the world!’ and there a merry young huntsman sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do. Now the wild rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon the wild rock; and as a merry young huntsman saw three of fierce giants who lived upon it striding about, a merry young huntsman thought to a merry young huntsman, ‘a merry young huntsman can only save a merry young huntsman by feigning to be asleep’; so a merry young huntsman laid a merry young huntsman down as if a merry young huntsman were in a sound sleep. When three of them came up to a merry young huntsman, the first pushed a merry young huntsman with the first's foot, and said, ‘What worm is this that lies here curled up?’ ‘Tread upon a merry young huntsman and kill a merry young huntsman,’ said the second. ‘It’s not worth the trouble,’ said the third; ‘let a merry young huntsman live, a merry young huntsman’ll go climbing higher up the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and some cloud will come rolling and carry a merry young huntsman away.’ And three of them passed on. But a merry young huntsman had heard all three of them said; and as soon as three of them were gone, a merry young huntsman climbed to the top of the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and when a merry young huntsman had sat there a short time a cloud came rolling around a merry young huntsman, and caught a merry young huntsman in a whirlwind and bore a merry young huntsman along for some time, till a cloud settled in a garden, and a merry young huntsman fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages. Then a merry young huntsman looked around a merry young huntsman, and said, ‘a merry young huntsman wish a merry young huntsman had something to eat, if not a merry young huntsman shall be worse off than before; for here a merry young huntsman see neither apples nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last a merry young huntsman thought to a merry young huntsman, ‘a merry young huntsman can eat salad, salad will refresh and strengthen a merry young huntsman.’ So a merry young huntsman picked out a fine head and ate of a fine head; but scarcely had a merry young huntsman swallowed two bites when a merry young huntsman felt a merry young huntsman quite changed, and saw with horror that a merry young huntsman was turned into an ass. However, a merry young huntsman still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so a merry young huntsman ate on till a merry young huntsman came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had a merry young huntsman tasted another kind of salad when a merry young huntsman felt another change come over a merry young huntsman, and soon saw that a merry young huntsman was lucky enough to have found a merry young huntsman's old shape again. Then a merry young huntsman laid a merry young huntsman down and slept off a little of a merry young huntsman's weariness; and when a merry young huntsman awoke the next morning a merry young huntsman broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad, and thought to a merry young huntsman, ‘a head both of the good and the bad salad will help a merry young huntsman to a merry young huntsman's fortune again, and enable a merry young huntsman to pay off some folks for some folks's treachery.’ So a merry young huntsman went away to try and find the castle of a merry young huntsman's friends; and after wandering about a few days a merry young huntsman luckily found the castle of his friends. Then a merry young huntsman stained a merry young huntsman's face all over brown, so that even a merry young huntsman's mother would not have known a merry young huntsman, and went into the castle of his friends and asked for a lodging; ‘a merry young huntsman am so tired,’ said a merry young huntsman, ‘that a merry young huntsman can go no farther.’ ‘a merry young huntsman,’ said a little old woman, ‘who are a merry young huntsman? and what is a merry young huntsman's business?’ ‘a merry young huntsman am,’ said a merry young huntsman, ‘a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows under the sun. a merry young huntsman have been lucky enough to find the finest salad that grows under the sun, and have brought the finest salad that grows under the sun with a merry young huntsman; but the heat of the sun scorches so that the finest salad that grows under the sun begins to wither, and a merry young huntsman don’t know that a merry young huntsman can carry the finest salad that grows under the sun farther.’ When a little old woman and a very beautiful young lady heard of the bad salad, the witch and the young lady longed to taste the bad salad, and said, ‘a merry young huntsman, let the witch and the young lady just taste the bad salad.’ ‘To be sure,’ answered a merry young huntsman; ‘a merry young huntsman have two heads of the bad salad with a merry young huntsman, and will give the witch and the young lady one’; so a merry young huntsman opened a merry young huntsman's bag and gave the witch and the young lady the bad salad. Then a little old woman took the bad salad into the kitchen to be dressed; and when the bad salad was ready a little old woman could not wait till the bad salad was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put a few leaves in a little old woman's mouth, and scarcely were a few leaves swallowed when a little old woman lost a little old woman's own form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the bad salad ready, was going to carry the bad salad up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste the bad salad as a little old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so the servant-maid also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish with the bad salad fall on the ground. a merry young huntsman sat all this time with a little old woman, and as nobody came with the bad salad and a little old woman longed to taste the bad salad, a little old woman said, ‘a little old woman don’t know where the bad salad can be.’ Then a merry young huntsman thought something must have happened, and said, ‘a merry young huntsman will go into the kitchen and see.’ And as a merry young huntsman went a merry young huntsman saw two asses in the court running about, and the bad salad lying on the ground. ‘All right!’ said a merry young huntsman; ‘two asses have had two asses's share.’ Then a merry young huntsman took up the rest of the leaves, laid the rest of the leaves on the dish with the salad and brought the rest of the leaves to a little old woman, saying, ‘a merry young huntsman bring a little old woman the dish with the salad a merry young huntsman that a little old woman may not wait any longer.’ So a little old woman ate of the dish with the salad, and like the others ran off into the court braying away. Then a merry young huntsman washed a merry young huntsman's face and went into the court that they might know a merry young huntsman. ‘Now they shall be paid for they's roguery,’ said a merry young huntsman; and tied they to a rope and took they along with a merry young huntsman till a merry young huntsman came to a mill and knocked at the window. ‘What’s the matter?’ said the miller. ‘a merry young huntsman have they here,’ said a merry young huntsman; ‘if the miller will take they, give they food and room, and treat they as a merry young huntsman tell the miller, a merry young huntsman will pay the miller whatever the miller ask.’ ‘With all the miller's heart,’ said the miller; ‘but how shall the miller treat they?’ Then a merry young huntsman said, ‘Give a little old woman stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was a little old woman) hay three times a day and no stripes’: for a merry young huntsman could not find it in a merry young huntsman's heart to have the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) beaten. After this a merry young huntsman went back to the castle, where a merry young huntsman found everything a merry young huntsman wanted. Some days after, the miller came to a merry young huntsman and told a merry young huntsman that a little old woman was dead; ‘the others,’ said the miller, ‘are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful that the others cannot last long.’ Then a merry young huntsman pitied the others, and told the miller to drive the others back to a merry young huntsman, and when the others came, a merry young huntsman gave the others some of the good salad to eat. And a little old woman fell upon a little old woman's knees before a merry young huntsman, and said, ‘a merry young huntsman! forgive a little old woman all the ill a little old woman have done a merry young huntsman; a little old woman's mother forced a little old woman to it, it was against a little old woman's will, for a little old woman always loved a merry young huntsman very much. his cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for its heart, a little old woman will give its heart a merry young huntsman too.’ But a merry young huntsman said, ‘Keep its heart, it will be just the same thing, for a merry young huntsman mean to make a little old woman a merry young huntsman's wife.’ So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.","[[[1, 4], [25, 25], [34, 34],

58,THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS,"A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said: ‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh, it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not make me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing!’ Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes.’ The father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’ Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’ said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the sexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself off, you have no business here at night.’ The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’ uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he. I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg. She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks are these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’ ‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go away.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you. Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’ ‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate, understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke the father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you. Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’ ‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind.’ When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: ‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven. Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has never come my way before.’ The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the waggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah, be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again.’ But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’ The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’ The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’ ‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said: ‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but just show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’ Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he, ‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you, vermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing for me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a pity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad, and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he, ‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’ The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs to this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’ said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes, if you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’ said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he. ‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple of farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’ The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: ‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger, and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’ ‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go into your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot manage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I live.’ Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he, ‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’ ‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you go--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. ‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’ said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire. Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That is all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to shudder!’ Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still said always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder so?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!’","A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw the younger people said: ‘There’s the youngerA certain father !’ When anything had to be done, it was always the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything who was forced to do anything; but if the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything's bade the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything answered: ‘Oh, no A certain father, the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything’ll not go there, it makes the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything shudder!’ for the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh, it makes the listeners shudder!’ the younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of the listeners, and could not imagine what the rest of them could mean. ‘the rest of them are always saying: “It makes me shudder, It makes me shudder!” It does not make the younger shudder,’ thought the younger. ‘That, too, must be an art of which the younger understand nothing!’ Now it came to pass that A certain father said to the younger one day: ‘Hearken to A certain father, the younger, the younger are growing tall and strong, and you too must learn something by which the younger can earn the younger's bread. Look how the younger's brother works, but the younger do not even earn the younger's salt.’ ‘Well, A certain father,’ the younger replied, ‘the younger am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but be managed, the younger should like to learn how to shudder. the younger don’t understand That at all yet.’ the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything smiled when the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything heard that, and thought to the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything is! the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything will never be good for anything as long as the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything lives! He who wants to be a sickle must bend He who wants to be a sickle betimes.’ A certain father sighed, and answered the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything: ‘the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything will not earn your bread by shudder.’ Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and A certain father bewailed A certain father's trouble, and told the sexton how A certain father's was so backward in every respect that the younger knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’ said A certain father, ‘when A certain father asked the younger how the younger was going to earn your bread, the younger actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the sexton, ‘the younger can learn that with the sexton. Send the younger to the sexton, and the sexton will soon polish the younger.’ A certain father was glad to do polish, for A certain father thought: ‘polish will train the younger a little.’ the sexton therefore took the younger into the house, and the younger had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke the younger at midnight, and bade the younger arise and go up into the church tower and ring the church bell. ‘the younger shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought the sexton, and secretly went there before the younger; and when the younger was at the top of the church tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, the younger saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried the younger, but a white figure made no reply, and did not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the younger, ‘or take a white figure off, a white figure have no business here at night.’ the sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the younger might think the sexton was a ghost. the younger cried a second time: ‘What do a white figure want here?--speak if a white figure are an honest fellow, or the younger will throw a white figure down the steps!’ the sexton thought: ‘the younger can’t mean to be as bad as the younger's words,’ uttered no sound and stood as if the sexton were made of stone. Then the younger called to the sexton for the third time, and as called was also to no purpose, the younger ran against the sexton and pushed a white figure down the steps, so that a white figure fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon the younger rang the church bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. the sexton's wife waited a long time for The sexton’s wife's , but the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything did not come back. At length The sexton’s wife became uneasy, and wakened the younger, and asked: ‘Do the younger know where The sexton’s wife's is? the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything climbed up the church tower before the younger did.’ ‘No, the younger don’t know,’ replied the younger, ‘but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as someone would neither give an answer nor go away, the younger took someone for a scoundrel, and threw someone downstairs. Just go there and The sexton’s wife will see if it was someone. the younger should be sorry if it were.’ The sexton’s wife ran away and found The sexton’s wife's husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken someone's leg. The sexton’s wife carried someone down, and then with loud screams The sexton’s wife hastened to A certain father, ‘A certain father's ,’ cried The sexton’s wife, ‘has been the cause of a great misfortune! the younger has thrown someone down the steps so that someone broke his leg. Take the younger out of the house.’ A certain father was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the younger. ‘What wicked tricks are these?’ said A certain father. ‘The devil must have put these into the younger's head.’ ‘A certain father,’ the younger replied, ‘do listen to the younger. the younger am quite innocent. someone was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. the younger did not know who one intent on doing evil was, and the younger entreated someone three times either to speak or to go away.’ ‘Ah,’ said A certain father, ‘A certain father have nothing but unhappiness with the younger. Go out of A certain father's sight. A certain father will see the younger no more.’ ‘Yes, A certain father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will the younger go forth and learn how to shudder, and then the younger shall, at any rate, understand one art which will support the younger.’ ‘Learn what the younger will,’ spoke A certain father, ‘it is all the same to A certain father. Here are fifty talers for the younger. Take fifty talers and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence the younger come, and who is the younger's father, for A certain father have reason to be ashamed of the younger.’ ‘Yes, A certain father, it shall be as A certain father will. If A certain father desire nothing more than that, the younger can easily keep it in mind.’ When the day dawned, therefore, the younger put fifty talers into the younger's pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to the younger: ‘If the younger could but shudder! If the younger could but shudder!’ Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the younger was holding with the younger, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, a man said to the younger: ‘Look, there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning how to fly. Sit down beneath the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning how to fly, and wait till night comes, and the younger will soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered the younger, ‘that is easily done; but if the younger learn how to shudder as fast as that, The sexton’s wife shall have fifty talers. Just come back to A certain father early in the morning.’ Then the younger went to the gallows, sat down beneath the gallows, and waited till evening came. And as the younger was cold, the younger lighted the younger a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of a fire, the younger could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and the hanged men moved backwards and forwards, the younger thought to the younger: ‘If the hanged men shiver below by a fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!’ And as the younger felt pity for the hanged men, the younger raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of the hanged men after the other, and brought down the hanged men. Then the younger stoked a fire, blew a fire, and set the hanged men round a fire to warm the hanged men. But the hanged men sat there and did not stir, and a fire caught the hanged men's clothes. So the younger said: ‘Take care, or the younger will hang the hanged men up again.’ the hanged men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let the hanged men's rags go on burning. At this the younger grew angry, and said: ‘If the hanged men will not take care, the younger cannot help the hanged men, the younger will not be burnt with the hanged men,’ and the younger hung the hanged men up again each in the younger's turn. Then the younger sat down by a fire and fell asleep, and the next morning a man came to the younger and wanted to have fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do the younger know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’ answered the younger, ‘how should the younger know? the hanged men did not open the hanged men's mouths, and were so stupid that the hanged men let their rags get burnt.’ Then a man saw that a man would not get fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has never come a man's way before.’ the younger likewise went the younger's way, and once more began to mutter to the younger: ‘Ah, if the younger could but shudder! Ah, if the younger could but shudder!’ A waggoner who was striding behind the younger heard this and asked: ‘Who are the younger?’ ‘the younger don’t know,’ answered the younger. Then A waggoner who was striding behind him asked: ‘From whence do the younger come?’ ‘the younger know not.’ ‘Who is the younger's father?’ ‘That the younger may not tell A waggoner who was striding behind him.’ ‘What is it that the younger are always muttering between the younger's teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the younger, ‘the younger do so wish the younger could shudder, but no one can teach the younger how.’ ‘Enough of the younger's foolish chatter,’ said A waggoner who was striding behind him. ‘Come, go with A waggoner who was striding behind him, A waggoner who was striding behind him will see about a place for the younger.’ the younger went with A waggoner who was striding behind him, and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour the younger again said quite loudly: ‘If the younger could but shudder! If the younger could but shudder!’ The host who heard said, laughed and said: ‘If that is the younger's desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for the younger here.’ ‘Ah, be silent,’ said The sexton’s wife, ‘so many prying persons have already lost so many prying persons's lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again.’ But the younger said: ‘However difficult it may be, the younger will learn it. For this purpose indeed have the younger journeyed forth.’ the younger let The host who heard this have no rest, until The host who heard this told the younger, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if anyone would but watch in a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights for three nights. The king had promised that he who would venture should have the ropemaker’s daughter to wife, and the ropemaker’s daughter was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights lay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights, but as yet none had come out again. Then the younger went next morning to The king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, the younger will willingly watch three nights in a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights.’ The king looked at the younger, and as the younger pleased The king, The king said: ‘the younger may ask for three things to take into a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights with the younger, but three things to take into the castle with you must be things without life.’ Then the younger answered: ‘Then the younger ask for a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’ The king had a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife carried into a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights for The king during the day. When night was drawing near, the younger went up and made the younger a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside a bright fire, and seated the younger by a turning lathe. ‘Ah, if the younger could but shudder!’ said the younger, ‘but the younger shall not learn it here either.’ Towards midnight the younger was about to poke a fire, and as the younger was blowing a bright fire, something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’ ‘You fools!’ cried the younger, ‘what are You fools crying about? If You fools are cold, come and take a seat by a fire and warm You fools.’ And when the younger had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of the younger, and looked savagely at the younger with two great black cats's fiery eyes. After a short time, when two great black cats had warmed two great black cats, two great black cats said: ‘the younger, shall two great black cats have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ the younger replied, ‘but just show the younger two great black cats's paws.’ Then two great black cats stretched out your paws. ‘Oh,’ said the younger, ‘what long nails two great black cats have! Wait, the younger must first cut your paws for two great black cats.’ Thereupon the younger seized two great black cats by the throats, put two great black cats on the cutting-board and screwed two great black cats's feet fast. ‘the younger have looked at two great black cats's fingers,’ said the younger, ‘and the younger's fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and the younger struck two great black cats dead and threw two great black cats out into the water. But when the younger had made away with two great black cats, and was about to sit down again by a fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains came until the younger could no longer move, and black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains yelled horribly, and got on a fire, pulled a fire to pieces, and tried to put a fire out. the younger watched black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains for a while quietly, but at last when black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains were going too far, the younger seized the younger's cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains,’ and began to cut black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains down. Some of black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains ran away, the others the younger killed, and threw out into the water. When the younger came back the younger fanned the embers of a fire again and warmed the younger. And as the younger thus sat, the younger's eyes would keep open no longer, and the younger felt a desire to sleep. Then the younger looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing for the younger,’ said the younger, and got into That. When the younger was just going to shut his eyes, however, That began to move of That's own accord, and went over the whole of a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights. ‘That’s right,’ said the younger, ‘but go faster.’ Then That rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to That, up and down, over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, That turned over upside down, and lay on the younger like a mountain. But the younger threw quilts and pillows up in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and lay down by a fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning The king came, and when The king saw the younger lying there on the ground, The king thought evil spirits had killed the younger and the younger was dead. Then said The king: ‘After all it is a pity,--for so handsome a man.’ the younger heard it, got up, and said: ‘It has not come to that yet.’ Then The king was astonished, but very glad, and asked how the younger had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered the younger; ‘one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then the younger went to the innkeeper, who opened the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide's eyes very wide, and said: ‘The king never expected to see the younger alive again! Have the younger learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said the younger, ‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell the younger!’ The second night the younger again went up into a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights, sat down by a fire, and once more began the younger's old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first an uproar and noise of tumbling about was low, but an uproar and noise of tumbling about grew louder and louder. Then an uproar and noise of tumbling about was quiet for a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and fell before the younger. ‘Hullo!’ cried the younger, ‘another half belongs to this. This is not enough!’ Then an uproar and noise of tumbling about began again, there was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said the younger, ‘the younger will just stoke up a fire a little for The sexton’s wife.’ When the younger had done stoke and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting in the younger's place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’ said the younger, ‘the bench is mine.’ a hideous man wanted to push the younger away; the younger, however, would not allow push, but thrust a hideous man off with all the younger's strength, and seated the younger again in his place. Then still more men fell down, one after the other; still more men brought nine dead men’s legs and two skulls, and set nine dead men’s legs and two skulls up and played at nine-pins with nine dead men’s legs and two skulls. the younger also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen still more men, can the younger join still more men?’ ‘Yes, if the younger have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied the younger, ‘but still more men's balls are not quite round.’ Then the younger took two skulls and put two skulls in a turning lathe and turned two skulls till two skulls were round. ‘There, now two skulls will roll better!’ said the younger. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ the younger played with two skulls and lost some of the younger's money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from the younger's sight. the younger lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning The king came to inquire after the younger. ‘How has it fared with the younger this time?’ asked The king. ‘the younger have been playing at nine-pins,’ the younger answered, ‘and have lost a couple of farthings.’ ‘Have the younger not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said the younger, ‘the younger have had a wonderful time! If the younger did but know what it was to shudder!’ The third night the younger sat down again on the younger's bench and said quite sadly: ‘If the younger could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a coffin. Then the younger said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly the younger's little cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and the younger beckoned with the younger's finger, and cried: ‘Come, my little cousin, who died only a few days ago, come.’ six tall men placed a coffin on the ground, but the younger went to a coffin and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. the younger felt a dead man's face, but his face was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said the younger, ‘the younger will warm a dead man a little,’ and went to a fire and warmed the younger's hand and laid his hand on his face, but a dead man remained cold. Then the younger took a dead man out, and sat down by a fire and laid a dead man on the younger's breast and rubbed the younger's arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, the younger thought to the younger: ‘When two people lie in bed together, two people warm each other,’ and carried a dead man to the bed, covered a dead man over and lay down by a dead man. After a short time a dead man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the younger, ‘See, a dead man, have the younger not warmed a dead man?’ a dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will a dead man strangle the younger.’ ‘What!’ said the younger, ‘is that the way a dead man thank A certain father? a dead man shall at once go into a dead man's coffin again,’ and the younger took a dead man up, threw a dead man into your coffin, and shut the lid. Then came the six men and carried a dead man away again. ‘a dead man cannot manage to shudder,’ said a dead man. ‘a dead man shall never learn shudder here as long as a dead man live.’ Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. a man was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘the younger,’ cried a man, ‘the younger shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for the younger shall die.’ ‘Not so fast,’ replied the younger. ‘If the younger am to die, the younger shall have to have a say in die.’ ‘A certain father will soon seize the younger,’ said A certain father. ‘Softly, softly, do not talk so big. A certain father am as strong as a man are, and perhaps even stronger.’ ‘We shall see,’ said a man. ‘If the younger are stronger, a man will let the younger go--come, We will try.’ Then a man led the younger by dark passages to a smith’s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. ‘the younger can do better than struck,’ said the younger, and went to the other anvil. a man placed a man near and wanted to look on, and a long white beard hung down. Then the younger seized an axe, split the other anvil with one blow, and in the other anvil caught a long white beard. ‘Now the younger have a man,’ said the younger. ‘Now it is a man's turn to die.’ Then the younger seized an iron bar and beat a man till a man moaned and entreated the younger to stop, when a man would give a man great riches. the younger drew out an axe and let a man go. a man led the younger back into a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights, and in a cellar showed the younger three chests full of gold. ‘Of three chests full of gold,’ said a man, ‘one part is for the poor, the other for The king, the third the younger.’ In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the younger stood in darkness. ‘the younger shall still be able to find the younger's way out,’ said the younger, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there by a fire. Next morning The king came and said: ‘Now the younger must have learnt what shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ the younger answered; ‘what can shuddering be? the younger's dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed the younger a great deal of money down below, but no one told the younger what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said The king, ‘the younger have saved a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights, and shall marry the ropemaker’s daughter.’ ‘That is all very well,’ said the younger, ‘but still the younger do not know what it is to shudder!’ Then a great deal of money was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the younger loved The sexton’s wife, and however happy the younger was, the younger still said always: ‘If the younger could but shudder--if the younger could but shudder.’ And said at last angered The sexton’s wife. The sexton’s wife's waiting-maid said: ‘Her waiting-maid will find a cure for the younger; the younger shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ Her waiting-maid went out to the stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to Her waiting-maid. At night when the younger was sleeping, The sexton’s wife was to draw the clothes off the younger and empty a whole bucketful of gudgeons full of cold water with a whole bucketful of gudgeons a whole bucketful of gudgeons over the younger, so that the little fishes would sprawl about the younger. Then the younger woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes the younger shudder so?--what makes the younger shudder so, The sexton’s wife? Ah! now the younger know what it is to shudder!’","[[[22, 23], [38, 38], [45, 53], [50, 50], [165, 166], [210, 210], [215, 215], [228, 228], [239, 239], [243, 243], [252, 257], [259, 259], [274, 274],

59,KING GRISLY-BEARD,"A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she only made sport of them. Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’ said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard. But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door. Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, ‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’ Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King Grisly-beard!’ Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she. ‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’ At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she; ‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said, ‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’ sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’ But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat.’ Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left, and on this they lived. She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take home. All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.’ Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party.","A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the princes who came to ask a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited in marriage was good enough for a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited only made sport of the princes who came to ask her in marriage. Once upon a time A great king of a land far away in the East held a great feast, and asked thither all a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's suitors; and all her suitors sat in a row, ranged according to all her suitors's rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights. Then a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited came in, and as a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited passed by all her suitors a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘The first’s as round as a tub,’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. The fourth was too pale, and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited called The fourth ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too red, so a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited called The fifth ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough; so a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited said The sixth was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker’s oven. And thus a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited had some joke to crack upon every one: but a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at a good king who was there,’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited; ‘a good king who was there's beard is like an old mop; a good king who was there shall be called Grisly-beard.’ So a good king who was there got the nickname of Grisly-beard. But A great king of a land far away in the East was very angry when A great king of a land far away in the East saw how A great king of a land far away in the East's behaved, and how a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited ill-treated all her suitors; and A great king of a land far away in the East vowed that, willing or unwilling, a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door. Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when A great king of a land far away in the East heard a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms, A great king of a land far away in the East said, ‘Let a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms come in.’ So they brought in a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms had sung before A great king of a land far away in the East and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms begged a boon. Then A great king of a land far away in the East said, ‘a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms have sung so well, that A great king of a land far away in the East will give a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms A great king of a land far away in the East's for a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms's wife.’ a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited begged and prayed; but A great king of a land far away in the East said, ‘A great king of a land far away in the East have sworn to give a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited to a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms, and A great king of a land far away in the East will keep A great king of a land far away in the East's word.’ So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited was married to a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms. When this was over A great king of a land far away in the East said, ‘Now get ready to go--a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited must not stay here--a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited must travel on with a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms.’ Then a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms went a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms's way, and took a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited with a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms, and they soon came to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, ‘whose is a great wood?’ ‘a great wood belongs to King Grisly-beard,’ answered a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; ‘hadst a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited taken King Grisly-beard, all had been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited am!’ sighed a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited; ‘would that a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited had married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose are some fine meadows?’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. ‘some fine meadows belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited taken King Grisly-beard, some fine meadows had all been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited am!’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited; ‘would that a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited had married King Grisly-beard!’ Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is a great city?’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. ‘a great city belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited taken King Grisly-beard, a great city had all been thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited am!’ sighed a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited; ‘why did a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited not marry King Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms,’ said a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms: ‘why should a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited wish for another husband? Am not a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms good enough for a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited?’ At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited; ‘to whom does a small cottage belong?’ Then a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms said, ‘a small cottage is a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's and a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms's house, where they are to live.’ ‘Where are a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms's servants?’ cried a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. ‘What do they want with servants?’ said a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; ‘a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited must do for a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms's supper, for a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms am very tired.’ But a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms was forced to help a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms called a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited up very early in the morning to clean a small cottage. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in a small cottage, a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms said, ‘a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, they can’t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited must learn to weave baskets.’ Then a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms went out and cut willows, and brought willows home, and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited began to weave; but weave made a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's fingers very sore. ‘a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms see weave won’t do,’ said a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms: ‘try and spin; perhaps a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited will do spin better.’ So a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her fingers till the blood ran. ‘See now,’ said a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms, ‘a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited are good for nothing; a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited can do no work: what a bargain a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms have got! However, a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms’ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited shall stand in the market and sell pots and pans.’ ‘Alas!’ sighed a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, ‘if any of a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's father’s court should pass by and see a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited standing in the market, how any of my father’s court will laugh at a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited!’ But a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms did not care for that, and said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited must work, if a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited did not wish to die of hunger. At first a trade in pots and pans went well; for many people, seeing a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, went to buy a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's wares, and paid many people's money without thinking of taking away her wares. the king and the princess lived on this as long as this lasted; and then a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms bought a fresh lot of ware, and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited sat a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited down with a fresh lot of ware in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode a drunken soldier's horse against a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's stall, and broke a fresh lot of ware into a thousand pieces. Then a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited began to cry, and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited?’ said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited; ‘what will a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms say?’ So a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited ran home and told a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms all. ‘Who would have thought a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited would have been so silly,’ said a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms, ‘as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let the king and the princess have no more crying; a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms see a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited are not fit for this sort of work, so a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms have been to A great king of a land far away in the East's palace, and asked if A great king of a land far away in the East did not want a kitchen-maid; and A great king of a land far away in the East say A great king of a land far away in the East will take a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, and there a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited will have plenty to eat.’ Thus a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left, and on some of the meat that was left the king and the princess lived. a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited had not been there long before a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited heard that A great king of a land far away in the East eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited went to one of the windows and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there. Then a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited so low. And the servants gave a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited some of the rich meats, which a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited put into a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's basket to take home. All on a sudden, as a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited was going out, in came the king’s eldest son; and when the king’s eldest son saw a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited at the door, the king’s eldest son took a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited by the hand, and said a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited should be the king’s eldest son's partner in the dance; but a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited trembled for fear, for a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. However, the king’s eldest son kept fast hold, and led a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited in; and the cover of her basket came off, so that some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take home fell about. Then everybody laughed and jeered at a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited; and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited was so abashed, that a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited wished a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited a thousand feet deep in the earth. a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps the king’s eldest son overtook a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, and brought a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited back and said, ‘Fear the king’s eldest son not! the king’s eldest son am the fiddler who has lived with a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited in a small cottage. the king’s eldest son brought a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited there because the king’s eldest son really loved a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited. the king’s eldest son am also the soldier that overset a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's stall. the king’s eldest son have done all this only to cure a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited of a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's silly pride, and to show a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited the folly of a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's ill-treatment of the king’s eldest son. Now all is over: a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold they's marriage feast.’ Then the chamberlains came and brought a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited the most beautiful robes; and my father’s and the court were there already, and welcomed a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's home on a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited's marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. our marriage feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited only wish that you and a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited had been of the party.","[[[12, 27], [38, 38], [45, 45], [48, 48], [70, 70], [108, 109], [115, 115], [119, 119], [146, 146], [161, 161], [176, 176], [185, 185], [199, 199], [214, 214], [237, 237], [248, 248], [268, 268], [310, 311], [316, 316], [333, 333], [409, 410], [434, 435], [441, 442], [458, 458], [488, 488], [510, 510], [516, 516], [521, 521], [534, 534], [552, 552], [576, 576], [592, 592], [597, 597], [602, 602], [629, 629], [641, 641], [658, 658], [663, 663], [668, 668], [694, 694], [706, 706], [722, 722], [727, 727], [732, 732], [757, 757], [769, 769], [789, 789], [810, 810], [830, 830], [845, 845], [849, 849], [878, 879], [895, 895], [914, 914], [951, 951], [966, 966], [988, 988], [996, 996], [1020, 1020], [1028, 1028], [1040, 1040], [1058, 1058], [1064, 1064], [1093, 1093], [1109, 1109], [1115, 1115], [1124, 1124], [1135, 1135], [1139, 1139], [1149, 1149], [1154, 1154], [1175, 1178], [1183, 1183], [1210, 1210], [1220, 1220], [1222, 1222], [1246, 1246], [1252, 1252], [1260, 1260], [1279, 1279], [1283, 1283], [1288, 1288], [1294, 1294], [1307, 1307], [1346, 1346], [1384, 1384], [1388, 1388], [1397, 1398], [1417, 1417], [1437, 1437], [1444, 1444], [1462, 1462], [1490, 1490], [1501, 1501], [1509, 1509], [1517, 1517], [1520, 1520], [1532, 1532], [1551, 1553], [1560, 1560], [1567, 1567], [1577, 1577], [1583, 1583], [1598, 1598], [1609, 1609], [1636, 1636], [1639, 1639], [1645, 1645], [1647, 1647], [1656, 1656], [1674, 1674], [1678, 1678], [1696, 1696], [1703, 1703], [1709, 1709], [1718, 1718], [1729, 1729], [1731, 1731], [1738, 1738], [1742, 1742], [1754, 1754], [1776, 1776], [1783, 1783], [1795, 1795], [1798, 1798], [1825, 1825], [1831, 1831]], [[32, 40], [53, 53]], [[0, 10], [59, 60], [300, 302], [307, 307], [310, 310], [321, 321], [325, 325], [375, 376], [380, 380], [406, 407], [418, 419], [430, 430], [434, 434], [448, 449], [453, 453], [465, 465], [468, 468], [499, 500], [1361, 1363], [1369, 1369], [1379, 1379], [1381, 1381], [1447, 1449], [1539, 1541]], [[69, 71], [74, 75], [84, 84], [118, 118], [320, 322]], [[129, 130], [136, 136]], [[178, 179], [187, 187]], [[192, 193], [201, 201]], [[206, 207], [216, 216]], [[254, 259], [264, 264], [271, 271], [279, 279], [289, 290]], [[358, 371], [378, 378], [385, 385], [394, 398], [402, 402], [412, 412], [423, 423], [433, 433], [437, 437], [460, 462], [492, 493], [521, 522], [526, 527], [529, 529], [536, 536], [572, 572], [747, 747], [751, 752], [765, 765], [803, 804], [812, 812], [825, 825], [842, 842], [867, 867], [871, 871], [889, 890], [911, 912], [946, 947], [975, 975], [1002, 1002], [1012, 1012], [1054, 1055], [1073, 1073], [1079, 1079], [1139, 1140], [1210, 1211], [1288, 1289], [1299, 1299], [1316, 1316], [1344, 1344], [1357, 1357]], [[543, 545], [557, 558], [562, 562]], [[565, 568], [578, 578], [605, 608], [635, 638], [643, 643], [671, 674], [700, 703], [708, 708], [735, 738]], [[539, 539], [612, 612], [678, 678], [774, 774], [816, 816], [835, 835], [898, 898], [905, 905], [927, 927], [935, 935], [953, 953], [1765, 1765]], [[615, 617], [622, 625], [632, 632], [645, 645]], [[681, 683], [688, 690], [697, 697], [710, 710]], [[777, 779], [795, 798], [808, 808], [923, 924], [943, 944], [1698, 1699]], [[980, 980], [984, 984]], [[991, 991], [994, 994], [1004, 1005]], [[1017, 1017], [1023, 1023]], [[996, 997], [1040, 1042]], [[1088, 1090], [1101, 1101]], [[1097, 1098], [1127, 1128], [1230, 1231], [1329, 1330]], [[1113, 1118], [1131, 1131]], [[1085, 1090], [1165, 1166]], [[1171, 1172], [1188, 1188]], [[1183, 1184], [1195, 1196]], [[406, 410], [1198, 1198], [1338, 1338], [1434, 1434]], [[1201, 1201], [1205, 1205]], [[1213, 1217], [1225, 1225], [1251, 1253]], [[1234, 1236], [1243, 1243]], [[1227, 1231], [1326, 1330]], [[1423, 1429], [1433, 1433]], [[1447, 1451], [1539, 1545], [1549, 1549], [1558, 1558], [1570, 1570], [1602, 1602], [1669, 1672], [1685, 1685], [1688, 1688], [1701, 1701], [1706, 1706], [1711, 1711], [1721, 1721], [1747, 1747]], [[1520, 1521], [1616, 1617], [1626, 1626]], [[1510, 1524], [1623, 1626]], [[1555, 1556], [1659, 1660]], [[1115, 1117], [1783, 1784], [1786, 1786]], [[1484, 1485], [1786, 1788]], [[1765, 1767], [1810, 1811]]]"
60,IRON HANS,"There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ‘Perhaps some accident has befallen him,’ said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ‘Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three.’ But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The king, however, would not give his consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.’ The huntsman replied: ‘Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.’ The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety. The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran thither and said: ‘Give me my ball out.’ ‘Not till you have opened the door for me,’ answered the man. ‘No,’ said the boy, ‘I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away. The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: ‘Open my door,’ but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: ‘I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.’ Then the wild man said: ‘It lies under your mother’s pillow, you can get it there.’ The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ‘Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!’ The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court. When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: ‘You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.’ He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said: ‘Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.’ The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: ‘What has happened to the well?’ ‘Nothing nothing,’ he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said: ‘You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let anything go in.’ By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened. ‘You have let a hair fall into the well,’ said he. ‘I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me.’ On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said: ‘Take the handkerchief off.’ Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. ‘You have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is. But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: “Iron Hans,” and then I will come and help you. My power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.’ Then the king’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king’s notice, and he said: ‘When you come to the royal table you must take your hat off.’ He answered: ‘Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.’ Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy. And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king’s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: ‘Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.’ He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: ‘How can you take the king’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’ ‘Oh, no,’ replied the boy, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.’ When he got into the room, the king’s daughter said: ‘Take your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.’ He again said: ‘I may not, I have a sore head.’ She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said: ‘I present them to your children, they can play with them.’ The following day the king’s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money. Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener’s boy: ‘I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.’ The others laughed, and said: ‘Seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you.’ When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called ‘Iron Hans’ three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said: ‘What do you desire?’ ‘I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.’ ‘That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.’ Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king’s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked the wild man. ‘Take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.’ All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. ‘I am not the one who carried away the victory,’ said he, ‘but a strange knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.’ The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said: ‘He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.’ She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said: ‘He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here comes our hobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more ridiculed.’ The king said to his daughter: ‘I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown man will show himself.’ When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked he. ‘That I may catch the king’s daughter’s golden apple.’ ‘It is as safe as if you had it already,’ said Iron Hans. ‘You shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.’ When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king’s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away. On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew angry, and said: ‘That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.’ He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him. On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the king’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword. The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king. The following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener about his boy. ‘He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.’ The king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. But the king’s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?’ asked the king. ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘and here the apples are,’ and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king. ‘If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.’ ‘If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is your father?’ ‘My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.’ ‘I well see,’ said the king, ‘that I owe my thanks to you; can I do anything to please you?’ ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.’ The maiden laughed, and said: ‘He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,’ and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: ‘I am Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.’","There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals sent out a huntsman to shoot a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals a roe, but a huntsman did not come back. ‘Perhaps some accident has befallen a huntsman,’ said a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, and the next day a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for a huntsman, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day, a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals sent for all a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's huntsmen, and said: ‘Scour a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals through, and do not give up until all his huntsmen have found all his huntsmen.’ But of all his huntsmen, none came home again, none were seen again. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, and a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced an unknown huntsman to a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals as seeking a situation, and offered to go into a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, however, would not give a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in there; a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals fear it would fare with an unknown huntsman no better than with the others, and an unknown huntsman would never come out again.’ an unknown huntsman replied: ‘a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, an unknown huntsman will venture it at an unknown huntsman's own risk, of fear an unknown huntsman know nothing.’ an unknown huntsman therefore betook an unknown huntsman with an unknown huntsman's dog to a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. It was not long before his dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue some game; but hardly had his dog run two steps when his dog stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched a naked arm out of the water, seized his dog, and drew his dog under. When an unknown huntsman saw that, an unknown huntsman went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water. When three men could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees's face down to a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees's knees. three men bound a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees with cords, and led a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees away to the castle. There was great astonishment over a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees; a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, however, had a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees put in an iron cage in a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen the queen herself was to take the key into the queen herself's keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals with safety. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals had a son of eight years, who was once playing in his courtyard, and while a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was playing, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's golden ball fell into an iron cage in his courtyard. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard ran thither and said: ‘Give a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard his golden ball out.’ ‘Not till a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have opened the door for a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals,’ answered a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. ‘No,’ said a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard will not do opened; a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals has forbidden opened,’ and ran away. The next day a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard again went and asked for his golden ball; a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals said: ‘Open the door,’ but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard would not. On the third day a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals had ridden out hunting, and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard went once more and said: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard cannot open the door even if a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard wished, for a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have not the key.’ Then a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals said: ‘the key lies under a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's pillow, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard can get the key there.’ a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyardhis golden ball , cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. the door opened with difficulty, and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard pinched a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's fingers. When the door was open a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals stepped out, gave a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard his golden ball, and hurried away. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard had become afraid; a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard called and cried after a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals: ‘Oh, a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, do not go away, or a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard shall be beaten!’ a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals turned back, took a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard up, set a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard on a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's shoulder, and went with hasty steps into a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. When a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals came home, a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals observed an iron cage in his courtyard, and asked the queen herself how that had happened. the queen herself knew nothing about that, and sought the key, but the key was gone. the queen herself called a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, but no one answered. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals sent out people to seek for a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard in the fields, but people did not find a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. Then a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court. When a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals had once more reached a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals took a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard down from his shoulder, and said to a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard will never see a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's father and mother again, but a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals will keep a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard with a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, for a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have set a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals free, and a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals have compassion on a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. If a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard do all a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals bid a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard shall fare well. Of treasure and gold have a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals enough, and more than anyone in the world.’ a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals made a bed of moss for a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard on which a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals slept, and the next morning a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals took a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard to a well, and said: ‘Behold, a well is as bright and clear as crystal, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard shall sit beside a well, and take care that nothing falls into a well, or a well will be polluted. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals will come every evening to see if a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have obeyed a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's order.’ a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard placed a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard by the brink of a well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show a golden fish or a golden snake therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was thus sitting, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's finger hurt a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard so violently that a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard involuntarily put his finger in the water. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard drew his finger quickly out again, but saw that his finger was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals came back, looked at a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and said: ‘What has happened to a well?’ ‘Nothing nothing,’ a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard answered, and held his finger behind a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's back, that a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals might not see his finger. But a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals said: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have dipped his finger into the water, this time his finger may pass, but take care a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard do not again let anything go in.’ By daybreak a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was already sitting by a well and watching a well. his finger hurt a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard again and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard passed his finger over a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into a well. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard took a hair quickly out, but a hair was already quite gilded. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals came, and already knew what had happened. ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have let a hair fall into a well,’ said a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. ‘a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals will allow a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard to watch by his finger once more, but if this happens for the third time then a well is polluted and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard can no longer remain with a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals.’ On the third day, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard sat by a well, and did not stir his finger, however much his finger hurt a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. But the time was long to a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard looked at the reflection of a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's face on the surface of the water. And as a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard still bent down more and more while a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's long hair fell down from a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's shoulders into the water. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard raised a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how terrified a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was! a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard took a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's pocket-handkerchief and tied his pocket-handkerchief round his head, in order that a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals might not see his pocket-handkerchief. When a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals came a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals already knew everything, and said: ‘Take his pocket-handkerchief off.’ Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard excuse a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard as a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard might, it was of no use. ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard will learn what poverty is. But as a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have not a bad heart, and as a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals mean well by a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, there is one thing a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals will grant a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard; if a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard fall into any difficulty, come to a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals and cry: “Iron Hans,” and then a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals will come and help a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's power is great, greater than a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard think, and a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals have gold and silver in abundance.’ Then a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard left a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard reached a great city. There a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard looked for work, but could find none, and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard learnt nothing by which a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard could help a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. At length a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard went to the palace, and asked if the palace would take a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard in. The people about the royal court did not at all know what use The people about court could make of a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, but The people about court liked a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and told a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard to stay. At length the cook took a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard into the cook's service, and said a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard to carry the food to the royal table, but as a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard did not like to let a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's golden hair be seen, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard kept a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's little cap on. Such a thing as kept had never yet come under a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals notice, and a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals said: ‘When a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard come to the royal table a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard must take his little cap off.’ a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard answered: ‘Ah, a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard cannot; a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have a bad sore place on his head.’ Then a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals had the cook called before the cook and scolded the cook, and asked how the cook could take such a boy as a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard into his service; and that a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals was to send the cook away at once. the cook, however, had pity on the cook, and exchanged the cook for the gardener’s boy. And now a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard took his little cap off that the air might cool a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. As the sun shone on his golden hair the sun glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's daughter, and up the king’s daughter sprang to see what that could be. Then the king’s daughter saw a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and cried to a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, bring the king’s daughter a wreath of flowers.’ a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard put his little cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound wild field-flowers together. When a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was ascending the stairs with wild field-flowers, the gardener’s met a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and said: ‘How can a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard take the king’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’ ‘Oh, no,’ replied a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please the king’s daughter's better.’ When a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard got into the room, the king’s daughter said: ‘Take his little cap off, it is not seemly to keep his little cap on in the king’s daughter's presence.’ a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard again said: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard may not, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have a sore head.’ the king’s daughter, however, caught at his little cap and pulled his little cap off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard wanted to run out, but the king’s daughter held a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard by the arm, and gave a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard a handful of ducats. With a handful of ducats a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard departed, but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard cared nothing for a handful of ducats. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard took a handful of ducats to the gardener’s, and said: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard present a handful of ducats to the gardener’s's children, your children can play with your children.’ The following day the king’s daughter again called to a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard that a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was to bring the king’s daughter a wreath of field-flowers, and then a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard went in with a wreath of field-flowers, the king’s daughter instantly snatched at his little cap, and wanted to take his little cap away from a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard held his little cap fast with both hands. the king’s daughter again gave a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard a handful of ducats, but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard would not keep a handful of ducats, and gave a handful of ducats to the gardener’s for playthings for your children. On the third day things went just the same; the king’s daughter could not get his little cap away from a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard would not have the king’s daughter's money. Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals gathered together a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's people, and did not know whether or not a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener’s : ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard a horse.’ The others laughed, and said: ‘Seek one for a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard when The others are gone, The others will leave one behind The others in the stable for a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard.’ When The others had gone forth, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard went into the stable, and led one out; one was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard mounted one, and rode away to a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. When a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard came to the outskirts, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard called ‘Iron Hans’ three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals appeared immediately, and said: ‘What do a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard desire?’ ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard want a strong steed, for a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard am going to the wars.’ ‘a strong steed a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard shall have, and still more than a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard ask for.’ Then a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals went back into a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, who led a horse that snorted with a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained's nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron's swords flashed in the sun. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard made over one to a stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron. When a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard got near the battlefield a great part of his people had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard galloped thither with a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. all who opposed him began to flee, but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead of returning to a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, however, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard conducted a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron by byways back to a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, and called forth Iron Hans. ‘What do a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard desire?’ asked a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. ‘Take back one and a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and give a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard one again.’ All that a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard asked was done, and soon a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was riding on one. When a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals returned to a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's palace, the king’s daughter went to meet a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, and wished a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals joy of a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's victory. ‘a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals am not the one who carried away his victory,’ said a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, ‘but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyarda great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron.’ the king’s daughter wanted to hear who a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was, but a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals did not know, and said: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard followed the enemy, and a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals did not see a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard again.’ the king’s daughter inquired of the gardener’s where the gardener’s boy was, but the gardener’s smiled, and said: ‘the gardener’s boy has just come home on the gardener’s boy's , and the others have been mocking the gardener’s boy, and crying: “Here comes hobblety jib, hobblety jib back again!” the others asked, too: “Under what hedge have the gardener’s boy been lying sleeping all the time?” So the gardener’s boy said: “the gardener’s boy did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without the gardener’s boy.” And then the gardener’s boy was still more ridiculed.’ a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals said to the king’s daughter: ‘a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and the king’s daughter shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard will show a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard.’ When a great feast that shall last for three days was announced, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard went out to a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, and called a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. ‘What do a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals desire?’ asked a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. ‘That a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard may catch a golden apple.’ ‘catch is as safe as if a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard had a golden apple already,’ said a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.’ When the day came, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard galloped to the spot, took a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. the king’s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of the knights caught a golden apple but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, only as soon as a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard had a golden apple a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard galloped away. On the second day a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals equipped a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard as a white knight, and gave a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard a white horse. Again a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was the only one who caught a golden apple, and a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard did not linger an instant, but galloped off with a golden apple. a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals grew angry, and said: ‘That is not allowed; a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard must appear before a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals and tell a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's name.’ a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals gave the order that if a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyarda golden apple, should go away again the knights should pursue a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and if a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard would not come back willingly, the knights were to cut a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard down and stab a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. On the third day, a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard received from a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard caught a golden apple. But when a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was riding off with a golden apple, a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals attendants pursued a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and one of the king’s attendants got so near a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard that one of them wounded a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard leg with the point of one of them's sword. a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard nevertheless escaped from the king’s attendants, but one leapt so violently that the helmet fell from his head, and the king’s attendants could see that a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard had golden hair. the king’s attendants rode back and announced this to a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. The following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener’s about the gardener’s boy. ‘the gardener’s boy is at work in the garden; the gardener’s boy has been at a great feast that shall last for three days too, and only came home yesterday evening; the gardener’s boy has likewise shown the king’s daughter's children three golden apples which the gardener’s boy has won.’ a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals had the gardener’s boy summoned into a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's presence, and the gardener’s boy came and again had the gardener’s boy's on the gardener’s boy's . But the king’s daughter went up to the gardener’s boy and took his little cap off, and then the gardener’s boy's fell down over the gardener’s boy's , and the gardener’s boy was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are the gardener’s boy the knight who came every day to a great feast that shall last for three days, always in different colours, and who caught three golden apples which he has won?’ asked a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. ‘Yes,’ answered the gardener’s boy, ‘and here three golden apples which he has won are,’ and the gardener’s boy took three golden apples which he has won out of the gardener’s boy's pocket, and returned three golden apples which he has won to a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. ‘If a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals desire further proof, a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals may see the wound which a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's people gave the gardener’s boy when your people followed the gardener’s boy. But the gardener’s boy am likewise the knight who helped a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals to a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's victory over a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's enemies.’ ‘If the gardener’s boy can perform such deeds as that, the gardener’s boy are no gardener’s boy; tell a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, who is the gardener’s boy's father?’ ‘your father is a mighty king, and gold have the gardener’s boy in plenty as great as the gardener’s boy require.’ ‘a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals well see,’ said a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, ‘that a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals owe a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals's thanks to the gardener’s boy; can a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals do anything to please the gardener’s boy?’ ‘Yes,’ answered a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals, ‘that indeed a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals can. Give a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals the king’s daughter to wife.’ the king’s daughter laughed, and said: ‘a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard does not stand much on ceremony, but the king’s daughter have already seen by his golden hair that a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard was no gardener’s boy,’ and then the king’s daughter went and kissed a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard. your father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for your father and mother had given up all hope of ever seeing your father and mother's again. And as your father and mother were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue. a stately king went up to a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, embraced a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard and said: ‘a stately king am Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard have set a stately king free; all the treasures which a stately king possess, shall be a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard's property.’","[[[6, 23], [14, 14], [27, 27], [34, 34], [55, 56], [62, 62], [87, 87], [91, 91], [188, 189], [204, 205], [212, 212], [226, 226], [254, 254], [424, 425], [437, 437], [480,

61,CAT-SKIN,"There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing. Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made. When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday. Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, ‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work. Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’ Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’ When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.’ As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’ answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you in my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how did you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her business. After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let her go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head. But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch, Cat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white. Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it. Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, ‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.","There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the earth. But her fell ill, and when her felt that her's end drew near her called the king to her and said, ‘Promise her that the king will never marry again, unless the king meet with a wife who is as beautiful as her am, and who has golden hair like her.’ Then when the king in the king's grief promised all her asked, her shut her's eyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, the king's wise men said, ‘this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as her. But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So messengers came home, and had had all messengers's trouble for nothing. Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's , and had the same golden hair. And when a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was grown up, the king looked at a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair and saw that a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was just like her: then the king said to the king's courtiers, ‘May the king not marry a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair? a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair is the very image of the king's : unless the king have a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, the king shall not find any bride upon the earth, and his courtiers say there must be a queen.’ When his courtiers heard this his courtiers were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry a father's daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair said to the king, ‘Before a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair marry anyone a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of every beast in the kingdom's skin.’ And thus a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair thought the king would think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in the kingdom weave three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and the king's hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in the kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of all the beasts in his kingdom's skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made. When all were ready, the king sent a mantle of a thousand furs to a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair; but a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's trinkets, a golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair up in a mantle of a thousand furs, and besmeared a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's face and hands with soot. Then a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair threw a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair upon Heaven for help in a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair came to a large wood. As a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was very tired, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair sat a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair slept on till it was midday. Now as the king a large wood was hunting in a large wood, the king's dogs came to a tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to a tree, and when the huntsmen came back again said, ‘In a tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as the huntsmen never saw before; a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before's skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if the huntsmen can catch a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before alive, and the huntsmen will take a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before with the huntsmen.’ So the huntsmen took a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before up, and a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, ‘a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair and take a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair with the huntsmen.’ Then the huntsmen said, ‘Yes, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair will do for the kitchen; a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.’ So the huntsmen put a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair into the coach, and took a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's home to the king's palace. Then the huntsmen showed a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair a little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair may lie and sleep there.’ And a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work. Thus a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair!’ thought a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, ‘what will now become of a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair?’ But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s palace, so a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair said to the cook, ‘May a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair go up a little while and see what is going on? a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair will take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair may go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’ Then a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair took a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's little lamp, and went into a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's face and hands, so that a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair next opened a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's nutshell, and brought out of her nutshell the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to a feast. Everyone made way for a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, for nobody knew a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, and Everyone thought a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair could be no less than a king’s daughter. But the king came up to a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, and held out the king's hand and danced with a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair; and the king thought in the king's heart, ‘the king never saw any one half so beautiful.’ When danced was at an end a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair curtsied; and when the king looked round for a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but The guards that stood at the castle gate had seen no one. The truth was, that a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair had run into her cabin, pulled off the dress that shone like the sun, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair went into the kitchen to a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let rake alone till the morning, and heat the king's soup; the cook should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair don’t let a hair fall into it, or a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair will run a chance of never eating again.’ As soon as the cook went away, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair heated the king’s soup, and toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair could; and when the king’s soup was ready, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair went and looked in her cabin for a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's little golden ring, and put her little golden ring into the dish in which the king’s soup was. When danced was over, the king ordered the king’s soup to be brought in; and the king’s soup pleased the king so well, that the king thought the king had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom the king saw a gold ring lying; and as the king could not make out how a gold ring had got there, the king ordered the cook to be sent for. the cook was frightened when the cook heard the order, and said to a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, ‘a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair must have let a hair fall into the king’s soup; if it be so, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair will have a good beating.’ Then the cook went before the king, and the cook asked the cook who had cooked the king’s soup. ‘the cook did,’ answered the cook. But the king said, ‘cooked is not true; cooked was better done than the cook could do cooked.’ Then the cook answered, ‘To tell the truth the cook did not cook the king’s soup, but a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair did.’ ‘Then let a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair come up,’ said the king: and when a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair came the king said to a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, ‘Who are a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair?’ ‘a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair am a poor child,’ said a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair in the king’s palace?’ asked the king. ‘a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair am good for nothing,’ said a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, ‘but to be scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's head.’ ‘But how did a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair get a gold ring?’ asked the king. Then a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair would not own that a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair knew anything about a gold ring; so the king sent a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair away again about a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's business. After a time there was another feast, and a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair asked the cook to let a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair go up and see another feast as before. ‘Yes,’ said the cook, ‘but come again in half an hour, and cook the king’s soupthe king’s soup.’ Then a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair ran to her cabin, washed a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair quickly, and took a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put her dress on; and when a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair went in, looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, and rejoiced at seeing a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair again, and when the dance began the king danced with a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair. After the dance was at an end a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was gone; but a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair sprang into her cabin, and made a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the king’s soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair got the golden necklace and dropped the golden necklace into the king’s soup; then the golden necklace was brought to the kingthe golden necklace, and the golden necklace pleased the king as well as before; so the king sent for the cookthe golden necklace. a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was brought again before the king, but a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair still told the king that a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at my head. But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time, it happened just the same as before. ‘a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair must be a witch, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair,’ said the cook; ‘for a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair always put something into a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's soup, so that your soup pleases the king better than the cook.’ However, the cook let a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair go up as before. Then a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair put on the dress that shone like the sun, and went into the ball-room in the dress that shone like the sun; and the king danced with a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair again, and thought a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair had never looked so beautiful as a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair did then. So whilst the king was dancing with a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair, the king put a gold ring on a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's finger without a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair seeing a gold ring, and ordered that danced should be kept up a long time. When danced was at an end, the king would have held a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair fast by the hand, but a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that the king lost sight of a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair: and a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair ran as fast as a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair could into a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's little cabin under the stairs. But this time a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair had not time to take off the dress that shone like the sun, and threw a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together over the dress that shone like the sun, and in a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's haste did not blacken a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair all over with soot, but left one of a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's fingers white. Then a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon as the cook was gone, a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair put the golden brooch into the dish. When the king got to the bottom, the king ordered a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair to be called once more, and soon saw one of her fingers, and a gold ringone of her fingers : so the king seized a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's hand, and kept fast hold of her hand, and when a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair wanted to loose a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair and spring away, a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together fell off a little on one side, and the dress that shone like the sun sparkled underneath a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together. Then the king got hold of the fur and tore the fur off, and a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair could no longer hide a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair: so a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair washed soot and ashes from a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair's face, and showed a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, ‘a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair are the king's beloved bride, and they will never more be parted from each other.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in the kingdom, or indeed in any other.","[[[20, 20], [37, 39], [45, 45], [48, 48], [52, 52], [57, 57], [63, 63], [82, 82], [91,

62,SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED,"There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when there was nothing to do. The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said: ‘We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘Never so long as we live,’ and their mother would add: ‘What one has she must share with the other.’ They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew. No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not worry on their account. Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children. Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ‘Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings. One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said: ‘Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door. Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began to speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.’ ‘Poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out: ‘Leave me alive, children,   Snow-white, Rose-red,   Will you beat your wooer dead?’ When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest. Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived. When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white. ‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.’ Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees. A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do. He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ‘What are you up to, little man?’ asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the dwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!’ The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red. ‘You senseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch someone? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?’ ‘Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I will help you,’ and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children. Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you going?’ said Rose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘I am not such a fool!’ cried the dwarf; ‘don’t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water. The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’ Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone. It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off. The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their business in town. As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared at them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!’ The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again. The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in gold. ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment. Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red. ***** The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by poor health the brothers collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories ‘with the amusement of some young friends principally in view.’ They have been an essential ingredient of children’s reading ever since.","There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of a lonely cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage had two children who were like two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. two children who were like the two rose-trees were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only one was more quiet and gentle than one. one liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but one sat at home with one's , and helped a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage with a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage's housework, or read to a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage when there was nothing to do. two children who were like the two rose-trees were so fond of one another that two children who were like the two rose-trees always held each other by the hand when two children who were like the two rose-trees went out together, and when one said: ‘two children who were like the two rose-trees will not leave each other,’ one answered: ‘Never so long as two children who were like the two rose-trees live,’ and two children who were like the two rose-trees's would add: ‘What one has one must share with the other.’ two children who were like the two rose-trees often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did two children who were like the two rose-trees any harm, but came close to two children who were like the two rose-trees trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of two children who were like the two rose-trees's hands, the roe grazed by two children who were like the two rose-trees's side, the stag leapt merrily by two children who were like the two rose-trees, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever the birds knew. No mishap overtook two children who were like the two rose-trees; if two children who were like the two rose-trees had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, two children who were like the two rose-trees laid two children who were like the two rose-trees down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and two children who were like the two rose-trees's knew this and did not worry on two children who were like the two rose-trees's account. Once when two children who were like the two rose-trees had spent the night in the forest and the dawn had roused two children who were like the two rose-trees, two children who were like the two rose-trees saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near two children who were like the two rose-trees's bed. a beautiful child in a shining white dress got up and looked quite kindly at two children who were like the two rose-trees, but said nothing and went into the forest. And when two children who were like the two rose-trees looked round two children who were like the two rose-trees found that two children who were like the two rose-trees had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into a precipice in the darkness if two children who were like the two rose-trees had gone only a few paces further. And two children who were like the two rose-trees's told two children who were like the two rose-trees that it must have been the angel who watches over good children. two children who were like the two rose-trees kept two children who were like the two rose-trees's so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside a lonely cottage. In the summer one took care of a lonely cottage, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by one's bed before one awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter one lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. the kettle was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was the kettle polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage said: ‘Go, one, and bolt the door,’ and then two children who were like the two rose-trees sat round the fire, and a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage took a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage's spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and two children who were like the two rose-trees listened as two children who were like the two rose-trees sat and spun. And close by two children who were like the two rose-trees lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind two children who were like the two rose-trees upon a perch sat a white dove with a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings's head hidden beneath a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings's wings. One evening, as two children who were like the two rose-trees were thus sitting comfortably together, someone knocked at the door as if someone wished to be let in. a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage said: ‘Quick, one, open the door, someone must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.’ one went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that someone was a poor man, but someone was not; someone was a bear that stretched a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's broad, black head within the door. one screamed and sprang back, a lamb bleated, a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings fluttered, and one hid one behind her mother’s bed. But a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door began to speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door will do two children who were like the two rose-trees no harm! a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door am half-frozen, and only want to warm a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door a little beside two children who were like the two rose-trees.’ ‘a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door,’ said a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door do not burn a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's coat.’ Then a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage cried: ‘one, come out, a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door will do two children who were like the two rose-trees no harm, a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door means well.’ So two children who were like the two rose-trees came out, and by-and-by two children who were like the two rose-trees came nearer, and were not afraid of a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door. a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door said: ‘Here, two children who were like the two rose-trees, knock the snow out of your coat a little’; so two children who were like the two rose-trees brought the broom and swept a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's hide clean; and a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door stretched a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before two children who were like the two rose-trees grew quite at home, and played tricks with a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door. two children who were like the two rose-trees tugged a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's hair with two children who were like the two rose-trees's hands, put two children who were like the two rose-trees's feet upon a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's back and rolled a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door about, or two children who were like the two rose-trees took a hazel-switch and beat a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door, and when a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door growled two children who were like the two rose-trees laughed. But a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door took it all in good part, only when two children who were like the two rose-trees were too rough a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door called out: ‘Leave a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door alive, two children who were like the two rose-trees,   two children who were like the two rose-trees,   Will two children who were like the two rose-trees beat a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door dead?’ When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage said to a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door: ‘a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door can lie there by the fire, and then a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned two children who were like the two rose-trees let a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door out, and a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door trotted across the snow into the forest. Henceforth a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door came every evening at the same time, laid a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door down by the fire, and let two children who were like the two rose-trees amuse two children who were like the two rose-trees with a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door as much as two children who were like the two rose-trees liked; and two children who were like the two rose-trees got so used to a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door that the doors were never fastened until a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door had arrived. When spring had come and all outside was green, a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door said one morning to one: ‘Now a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.’ ‘Where are a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door going, then, a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door?’ asked one. ‘a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door must go into the forest and guard a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, the wicked dwarfs are obliged to stay below and cannot work the wicked dwarfs's way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, the wicked dwarfs break through the earth, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into the wicked dwarfs's hands, and in the wicked dwarfs's caves, does not easily see daylight again.’ one was quite sorry at a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's departure, and as one unbolted the door for a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door, and a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door was hurrying out, a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door caught against the bolt and a piece of your coat was torn off, and a piece of his hairy coat seemed to one as if one had seen gold shining through a piece of his hairy coat, but one was not sure about seen. a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees. A short time afterwards a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage sent two children who were like the two rose-trees into the forest to get firewood. There two children who were like the two rose-trees found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but two children who were like the two rose-trees could not make out what something was. When two children who were like the two rose-trees came nearer two children who were like the two rose-trees saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of a snow-white beard a yard long was caught in a crevice of a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do. a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long glared at two children who were like the two rose-trees with a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do two children who were like the two rose-trees stand there? Can two children who were like the two rose-trees not come here and help a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long?’ ‘What are a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long up to, a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long?’ asked one. ‘one!’ answered a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long: ‘a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long was going to split a big tree which lay felled on the ground to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with heavy logs; we people do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long wished; but the wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and a big tree which lay felled on the ground closed so quickly that a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long could not pull out a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's ; so now a snow-white beard a yard long is tight and a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long are!’ two children who were like the two rose-trees tried very hard, but two children who were like the two rose-trees could not pull a snow-white beard a yard long out, a snow-white beard a yard long was caught too fast. ‘one will run and fetch someone,’ said one. ‘one!’ snarled a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long; ‘why should one fetch someone? two children who were like the two rose-trees are already two too many for a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long; can one not think of something better?’ ‘Don’t be impatient,’ said one, ‘one will help a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long,’ and one pulled one's scissors out of one's pocket, and cut off the end of a snow-white beard a yard long. As soon as a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long felt a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long free a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and which was full of gold, and lifted a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold up, grumbling to a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off the end of the beard. Bad luck to Uncouth people!’ and then a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long swung a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold upon a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's back, and went off without even once looking at two children who were like the two rose-trees. Some time afterwards one one went to catch a dish of fish. As two children who were like the two rose-trees came near the brook two children who were like the two rose-trees saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if something like a large grasshopper were going to leap in. two children who were like the two rose-trees ran to something like a large grasshopper and found something like a large grasshopper was a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. ‘Where are a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long going?’ said one; ‘a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long am not such a fool!’ cried a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long; ‘don’t two children who were like the two rose-trees see that the accursed fish wants to pull a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long in?’ a lamb had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had tangled up a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long had not strength to pull a snow-white beard a yard long out; a big fish kept the upper hand and pulled a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long towards a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long held on to all the reeds and rushes, but held was of little good, for a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long was forced to follow the movements of a big fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water. two children who were like the two rose-trees came just in time; two children who were like the two rose-trees held a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long fast and tried to free a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's from the fishing-line, but all in vain, a snow-white beard a yard long and line were entangled fast together. There was nothing to do but to bring out her scissors and cut a snow-white beard a yard long, whereby a small part of a snow-white beard a yard long was lost. When a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long saw cut a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of the beard? Now you toadstool have cut off a small part of it. a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long cannot let a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long be seen by a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's people. a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long wish you toadstool had been made to run the soles off you toadstool's shoes!’ Then a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long dragged a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes away and disappeared behind a stone. It happened that soon afterwards a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage sent two children who were like the two rose-trees to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led two children who were like the two rose-trees across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There two children who were like the two rose-trees noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above two children who were like the two rose-trees; a large bird sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far away. Immediately two children who were like the two rose-trees heard a loud, piteous cry. two children who were like the two rose-trees ran up and saw with horror that a large bird had seized a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long, and was going to carry a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long off. two children who were like the two rose-trees, full of pity, at once took tight hold of a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long, and pulled against a large bird so long that at last a large bird let a large bird's booty go. As soon as a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long had recovered from a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's first fright a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long cried with a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's shrill voice: ‘Could two children who were like the two rose-trees not have done it more carefully! two children who were like the two rose-trees dragged at a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's brown coat so that my brown coat is all torn and full of holes, two children who were like the two rose-trees!’ Then a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under a rock not far away into a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's hole. The girls, who by this time were used to a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's ingratitude, went on two children who were like the two rose-trees's way and did two children who were like the two rose-trees's business in town. As two children who were like the two rose-trees crossed the heath again on two children who were like the two rose-trees's way home two children who were like the two rose-trees surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon precious stones; precious stones glittered and sparkled with all colours so beautifully that two children who were like the two rose-trees stood still and stared at precious stones. ‘Why do two children who were like the two rose-trees stand gaping there?’ cried a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long, and a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long was still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door came trotting towards two children who were like the two rose-trees out of the forest. a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long sprang up in a fright, but a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long could not reach a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's cave, for a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door was already close. Then in the dread of a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's heart a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long cried: ‘a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door, spare a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long, a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long will give a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door all a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's treasures; look, precious stones! Grant a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's life; what do a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door want with such a slender little fellow as a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long? a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door would not feel a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long between a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's teeth. Come, take two children who were like the two rose-trees, two children who were like the two rose-trees are tender morsels for a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat two children who were like the two rose-trees!’ a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door took no heed of a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's words, but gave a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long a single blow with a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's paw, and a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long did not move again. two children who were like the two rose-trees had run away, but a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door called to two children who were like the two rose-trees: ‘one , do not be afraid; wait, a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door will come with two children who were like the two rose-trees.’ Then two children who were like the two rose-trees recognized a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's voice and waited, and when a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door came up to two children who were like the two rose-trees suddenly a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's bearskin fell off, and a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door stood there a handsome man, clothed all in gold. ‘a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door am a king’s son,’ a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door said, ‘and a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door was bewitched by a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long; a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door was freed by a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's death. Now a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long has got a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long's well-deserved punishment. one was married to a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door, and one to a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door's brother, and they divided between they all my treasureshis cave. a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage lived peacefully and happily with a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage's children for many years. a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage took the two rose-trees with a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage, and the two rose-trees stood before a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage's window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red. ***** The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859)'s lives The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) remained close friends, and The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) studied law at Marburg University. Jacob (1785-1863) was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and although Wilhelm (1786-1859)'s work was hampered by poor health The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until a century after The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859)'s deaths. But The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) were best (and universally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814. Although The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859)'s intention was to preserve such material as part of German cultural and literary history, and the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814 was first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814 soon came into the possession of young readers. came was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814 ‘with the amusement of some young friends principally in view.’ the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814 have been an essential ingredient of children’s reading ever since.","[[[9, 11], [16, 17], [456, 460], [471, 471], [482, 483]], [[3, 11], [39, 39],
