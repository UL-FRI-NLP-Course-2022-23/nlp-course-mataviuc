The gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a living being to change a living being's nature. Jupiter said “Yes,” but Venus said “No.” So, to try the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a Maiden, and gave a Maiden to a young man for a wife. The wedding was duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding-feast. “See,” said Jupiter, to Venus, “how becomingly a Maiden behaves. Who could tell that yesterday a Maiden was but a Cat? Surely a Maiden's nature is changed?” “Wait a minute,” replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the room. No sooner did a Maiden see let than a Maiden jumped up from a Maiden's seat and tried to pounce upon a mouse. “Ah, you see,” said Venus, “Nature will out.”
