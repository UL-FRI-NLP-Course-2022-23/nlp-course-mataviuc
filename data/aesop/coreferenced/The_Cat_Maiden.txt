The wedding was duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding - feast . “ See , ” said Jupiter , to Venus , “ how becomingly Maiden behaves . Who could tell that yesterday Maiden was but a Cat ? Surely Maiden nature is changed ? ” “ Wait a minute , ” replied Venus , and let loose mouse into the room . No sooner did Maiden see let than Maiden jumped up from Maiden seat and tried to pounce upon mouse . “ Ah , you see , ” said Venus , “ Nature will out . ”
