One day countryman going to the nest of countryman Goose found there egg all yellow  glittering. When countryman took egg all yellow  glittering up egg all yellow  glittering was as heavy as lead and countryman was going to throw egg all yellow  glittering away, because countryman thought a trick had been played upon countryman . But countryman took egg all yellow  glittering home on second thoughts , and soon found to countryman delight that egg all yellow  glittering was an egg of pure gold . Every morning the same thing occurred , and countryman soon became rich by selling countryman eggs . As countryman grew rich countryman grew greedy ; and thinking to get at once all the gold Goose could give , countryman killed egg all yellow  glittering and opened egg all yellow  glittering only to find nothing . Greed oft oâ€™er reaches itself .
