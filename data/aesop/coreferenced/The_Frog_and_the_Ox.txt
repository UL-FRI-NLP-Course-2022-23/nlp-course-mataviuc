“ Oh Father, ” said child to himself, “ child have seen that ! that was as big as a mountain , with horns on that head , and a long tail , and that had hoofs divided in two . ” “ Tush , child , tush , ” said himself , “ that was Ox . that is n’t so big either ; himself may be a little bit taller than child , but himself could easily make himself quite as broad ; just you see . ” So himself blew himself out , and blew himself out , and blew himself out . “ Was himself as big as that ? ” asked himself . “ Oh , much bigger than that , ” said young Frog . Again himself blew himself out , and asked young Frog if Ox was as big as that . “ Bigger , himself , bigger , ” was the reply . So himself took a deep breath , and blew and blew and blew , and swelled and swelled and swelled . And then himself said : “ himself ’m sure Ox is not as big as this . But at this moment himself burst . Self - conceit may lead to self - destruction .
