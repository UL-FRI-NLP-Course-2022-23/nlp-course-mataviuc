Hares were so persecuted by the other beasts, Hares did not know where to go. As soon as Hares saw a single animal approach Hares , off Hares used to run . One day Hares saw a troop of wild Horses stampeding about , and in quite a panic Hares scuttled off to lake , determined to drown Hares rather than live in such a continual state of fear .
