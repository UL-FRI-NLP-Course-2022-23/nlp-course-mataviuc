Farmer one day came to the stables to see to Farmer beasts of burden: among them was Farmer favourite Ass, that was always well fed and often carried Farmer master . With Farmer came Farmer Lapdog , who danced about and licked Farmer hand and frisked about as happy as could be . Farmer felt in Farmer pocket , gave Lapdog some dainty food , and sat down while Farmer gave Farmer orders to Farmer servants . Lapdog jumped into Farmer master ’s lap , and lay there blinking while Farmer stroked Farmer ears . Ass , seeing this , broke loose from Farmer halter and commenced prancing about in imitation of Lapdog . Farmer could not hold Farmer sides with laughter , so Ass went up to Farmer , and putting Farmer feet upon Farmer ’s shoulder attempted to climb into Farmer lap . Farmer ’s servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taught Ass that Clumsy jesting is no joke .
