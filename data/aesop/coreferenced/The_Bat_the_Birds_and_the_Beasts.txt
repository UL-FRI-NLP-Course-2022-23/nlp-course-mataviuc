A great conflict was about to come off between Birds  Beasts. When Birds  Beasts were collected together Bat hesitated which to join. The Birds that passed Bat perch said : “ Come with Birds ” ; but Bat said : “ Bat am a Beast . ” Later on , some Beasts who were passing underneath Bat looked up and said : “ Come with Birds ” ; but Bat said : “ Bat am a Bird . ” Luckily at the last moment peace was made , and no battle took place , so Bat came to Birds and wished to join in the rejoicings , but Birds turned against Bat and Bat had to fly away . Bat then went to Beasts , but soon had to beat a retreat , or else Beasts would have torn Bat to pieces . “ Ah , ” said Bat , “ Bat see now , “ Bat that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends . ”
