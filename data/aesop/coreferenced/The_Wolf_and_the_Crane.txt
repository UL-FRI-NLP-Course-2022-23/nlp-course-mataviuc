Crane had been gorging on an animal Crane had killed, when suddenly bone stuck in Crane throat and Crane could not swallow bone. you soon felt terrible pain in you throat , and ran up and down groaning and groaning and seeking for something to relieve pain . you tried to induce every one you met to remove bone . “ you would give anything , ” said you , “ if you would take bone out . ” At last Crane agreed to try , and told you to lie on you side and open you jaws as wide as you could . Then Crane put Crane long neck down you ’s throat , and with Crane beak loosened bone , till at last bone got bone out . “ Will you kindly give Crane the reward you promised ? ” said Crane . you grinned and showed you teeth and said : “ Be content . Crane have put Crane head inside a Wolf ’s mouth and taken bone out again in safety ; that ought to be reward enough for you . ” Gratitude and greed go not together .
