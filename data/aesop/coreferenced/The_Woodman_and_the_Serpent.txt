One wintry day Woodman was tramping home from Woodman work when Woodman saw Serpent lying on the snow. When Woodman came closer Woodman saw Serpent was a Serpent to all appearance dead. But Woodman took Serpent up and put Serpent in Woodman bosom to warm while Woodman hurried home . As soon as Woodman got indoors Woodman put Serpent down on the hearth before the fire . The children watched Serpent and saw Serpent slowly come to life again . Then one of The children stooped down to stroke Serpent , but Serpent raised Serpent head and put out Serpent fangs and was about to sting child to death . So Woodman seized Woodman axe , and with one stroke cut Serpent in two . “ Ah , ” said Woodman , “ No gratitude from the wicked . ”
