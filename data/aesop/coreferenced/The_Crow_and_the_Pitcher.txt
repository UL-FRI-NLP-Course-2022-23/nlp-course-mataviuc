A Crow, half - dead with thirst, came upon Pitcher ; but when A Crow put A Crow beak into the mouth of Pitcher A Crow found another pebble only very little water was left in Pitcher , and another pebble A Crow could not reach far enough down to get at Pitcher . A Crow tried , and A Crow tried , but at last had to give up in despair . Then a thought came to A Crow , and A Crow took pebble and dropped Pitcher into Pitcher . Then A Crow took another pebble and dropped Pitcher into Pitcher . Then A Crow took another pebble and dropped another pebble into Pitcher . Then A Crow took another pebble and dropped another pebble into Pitcher . Then A Crow took another pebble and dropped another pebble into Pitcher . Then A Crow took another pebble and dropped another pebble into Pitcher . At last , at last , A Crow saw the water mount up near A Crow , and after casting in a few more pebbles A Crow was able to quench A Crow thirst and save A Crow life . Little by little does the trick .
