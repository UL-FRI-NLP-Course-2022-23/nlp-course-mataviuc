So , A Hare went to horse , and asked horse to carry A Hare away from hounds on horse back . But horse declined , stating that horse had important work to do for A Hare . “ horse felt sure , ” horse said , “ that all A Hare other friends would come to A Hare assistance . ” A Hare then applied to The bull , and hoped that horse would repel hounds with horse horns . The bull replied : “ The bull am very sorry , but The bull have an appointment with a lady ; but The bull feel sure that The goat will do what A Hare want . ” The goat , however , feared that horse back might do A Hare some harm if horse took A Hare upon it . The ram , horse felt sure , was the proper friend to apply to . So A Hare went to The ram and told horse the case . The ram replied : “ Another time , A Hare . The bull do not like to interfere on the present occasion , as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares . ” A Hare then applied , as a last hope , to the calf , who regretted that The bull was unable to help A Hare , as The bull did not like to take the responsibility upon himself , as so many older persons than himself had declined the task . By this time hounds were quite near , and A Hare took to A Hare heels and luckily escaped . horse that has many friends , has no friends .
