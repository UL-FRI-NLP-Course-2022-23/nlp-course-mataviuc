One fine day food occurred to Members that Members were doing all the work and Belly was having all food. So Members held a meeting, and after a long discussion , decided to strike work till Belly consented to take Belly proper share of the work . So for a day or two , Hands refused to take food , Mouth refused to receive food , and the Teeth had no work to do . But after a day or two Members began to find that Members themselves were not in a very active condition : Hands could hardly move , and Mouth was all parched and dry , while the Legs were unable to support the rest . So thus Members found that even Belly in Belly dull quiet way was doing necessary work for Body , and that all must work together or Body will go to pieces .
