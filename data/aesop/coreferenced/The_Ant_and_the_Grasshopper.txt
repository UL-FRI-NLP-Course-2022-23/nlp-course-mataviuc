In a field one summer ’s day Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to Grasshopper heart ’s content. Ant passed by , bearing along with great toil an ear of corn Ant was taking to the nest . “ Why not come and chat with Grasshopper , ” said Grasshopper , “ instead of toiling and moiling in that way ? ” “ Ant am helping to lay up food for winter , ” said Ant , “ and recommend Grasshopper to do the same . ” “ Why bother about winter ? ” said Grasshopper ; we have got plenty of food at present . ” But Ant went on Grasshopper way and continued Ant toil . When winter came Grasshopper had no food and found Grasshopper dying of hunger , while Grasshopper saw ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores ants had collected in the summer . Then Grasshopper knew : It is best to prepare for the days of necessity .
