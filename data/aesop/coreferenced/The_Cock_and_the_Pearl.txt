me was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly me espied something shinning amid straw. “ Ho! ho ! ” quoth me , “ something ’s for me , ” and soon rooted something out from beneath straw . “ What did something turn out to be but a Pearl something by some chance had been lost in the yard ? “ You may be a treasure , ” quoth me , “ to men that prize You , but for me me would rather have a single barley - corn than a peck of pearls . ” Precious things are for those that can prize Precious things .
