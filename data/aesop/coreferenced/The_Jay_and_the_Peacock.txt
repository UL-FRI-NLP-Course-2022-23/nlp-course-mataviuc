A Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there a number of feathers which had fallen from Peacocks when Peacocks were moulting. A Jay tied Peacocks all to A Jay tail and strutted down towards Peacocks . When A Jay came near Peacocks Peacocks soon discovered A Jay , and striding up to A Jay pecked at A Jay and plucked away A Jay borrowed plumes . So A Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays , who had watched A Jay behaviour from a distance ; but Peacocks were equally annoyed with A Jay , and told A Jay : “ It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds . ”
