A quarrel had arisen between you and Stag, so you came to Hunter to ask Hunter help to take revenge on Stag. Hunter agreed , but said : “ If you desire to conquer Stag , you must permit Hunter to place this piece of iron between you jaws , so that Hunter may guide you with these reins , and allow this saddle to be placed upon you back so that Hunter may keep steady upon you as we follow after Stag . ” you agreed to the conditions , and Hunter soon saddled and bridled you . Then with the aid of Hunter you soon overcame Stag , and said to Hunter : “ Now , get off , and remove those things from you mouth and back . ” “ Not so fast , friend , ” said Hunter . “ Hunter have now got you under bit and spur , and prefer to keep you as you are at present . ” If you allow men to use you for you own purposes , men will use you for men .
