A Fisher once took A Fisher bagpipes to the bank of river, and played upon them with the hope of making fish rise; but never a one put A Fisher nose out of the water . So A Fisher cast A Fisher net into river and soon drew net forth filled with fish . Then A Fisher took A Fisher bagpipes again , and , as A Fisher played , fish leapt up in net . “ Ah , fish dance now when A Fisher play , ” said A Fisher . “ Yes , ” said an old Fish : “ When fish are in man ’s power you must do as A Fisher bids you . ”
