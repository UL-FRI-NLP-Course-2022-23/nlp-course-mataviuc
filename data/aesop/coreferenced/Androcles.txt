Androcles once escaped from Androcles master and fled to the forest. As Androcles was wandering about there Androcles came upon Lion lying down moaning and groaning. At first Androcles turned to flee , but finding that Lion did not pursue Androcles , Androcles turned back and went up to Androcles . As Androcles came near , Lion put out Androcles paw , which was all swollen and bleeding , and Androcles found that huge thorn had got into paw of  Lion , who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog , and was causing all the pain . Androcles pulled out huge thorn and bound up the paw of Lion , who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog . Then Lion took Androcles to Androcles cave , and every day used to bring Androcles meat from which to live . But shortly afterwards both Androcles and Lion were captured , and Androcles was sentenced to be thrown to Lion , after Lion had been kept without food for several days . The Emperor and all Androcles Court came to see the spectacle , and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena . Soon Lion was let loose from Lion den , and rushed bounding and roaring towards Androcles . But as soon as Androcles came near to Androcles Androcles recognised Androcles , and fawned upon Androcles , and licked Lion hands like a friendly dog . The Emperor , surprised at this , summoned Androcles to Androcles , who told Androcles the whole story . Whereupon Androcles was pardoned and freed , and Lion let loose to Lion native forest . Gratitude is the sign of noble souls .
