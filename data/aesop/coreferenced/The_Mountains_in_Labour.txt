One day their noticed that Mountains were in labour; smoke came out of Mountains summits, the earth was quaking at Mountains feet , trees were crashing , and huge rocks were tumbling . their felt sure that something horrible was going to happen . their all gathered together in one place to see what terrible thing this could be . their waited and their waited , but nothing came . At last there was a still more violent earthquake , and gap appeared in the side of Mountains . their fell down upon their knees and waited . At last , and at last , its poked its little head and bristles out of gap and came running down towards their , and ever after their used to say : “ Much outcry , little outcome . ”
