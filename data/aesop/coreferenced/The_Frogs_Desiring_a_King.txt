us were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that just suited us; their went splashing about caring for nobody and nobody troubling with their. But some of their thought that this was not right , that their should have a king and a proper constitution , so their determined to send up a petition to Jove to give their what their wanted . “ Jove , ” their cried , “ send unto their a king that will rule over their and keep us in order . ” Jove laughed at their croaking , and threw down into swamp a huge Log , which came down splashing into swamp . their were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their midst , and their rushed to the bank to look at Log ; but after a time , seeing that Log did not move , one or two of the boldest of their ventured out towards Log , and even dared to touch Log ; still Log did not move . Then the greatest hero of their jumped upon Log and commenced dancing up and down upon Log , thereupon their their came and did the same ; and for some time their went about their business every day without taking the slightest notice of Log . But this did not suit their , so their sent another petition to Jove , and said to Jove , “ their want a real king ; one that will really rule over us . ” Now this made Jove angry , so Jove sent among their a big Stork that soon set to work gobbling their all up . Then their repented when too late . Better no rule than cruel rule .
