One moonlight night Fox was prowling about a farmer ’s hen - coop, and saw Cock roosting high up beyond Fox reach. “ Good news , good news ! ” Fox cried . “ Why , what is King Lion decree ? ” said Cock . “ King Lion has King Lion decree a universal truce . No beast may hurt a bird henceforth , but all shall dwell together in brotherly friendship . ” “ Why , King Lion ’s decree is good news , ” said Cock ; “ and there Fox see some one coming , with whom we can share good tidings . ” And so saying Fox craned Fox neck forward and looked afar off . “ What is it Fox see ? ” said Fox . “ It is only Cock master ’s Dog that is coming towards us . What , going so soon ? ” Fox continued , as Fox began to turn away as soon as Fox had heard good tidings . “ Will Fox not stop and congratulate Dog on the reign of universal peace ? ” “ Fox would gladly do so , ” said Fox , “ but Fox fear Cock may not have heard of King Lion ’s decree . ” Cunning often outwits Cunning .
