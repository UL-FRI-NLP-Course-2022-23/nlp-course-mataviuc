It happened that Fisher, after fishing all day, caught me . “ Pray , let me go , Fisher , ” said me . “ me am much too small for Fisher eating just now . If me put me back into the river me shall soon grow , then me can make a fine meal off me . ” “ Nay , nay , me , ” said Fisher , “ me have me now . me may not catch me hereafter . ” A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in prospect .
