The Lion and Fox went hunting together. The Lion, on the advice of Fox , sent a message to Ass , proposing to make an alliance between The Lion   Fox two families . Ass came to the place of meeting , overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance . But when The Lion came there The Lion simply pounced on Ass , and said to Fox : “ Here is The Lion   Fox dinner for to - day . Watch Fox here while The Lion go and have a nap . Woe betide Fox if Fox touch The Lion prey . ” The Lion went away and Fox waited ; but finding that The Lion did not return , ventured to take out brains of Ass and ate brains up . When The Lion came back The Lion soon noticed the absence of brains , and asked Fox in a terrible voice : “ What have Fox done with brains ? ” “ Brains , The Lion ! Ass had none , or Ass would never have fallen into The Lion trap . ” Wit has always an answer ready .
