Once upon a time Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when, looking up , what should Wolf see but you . “ There ’s Wolf supper , ” thought Wolf , “ if only Wolf can find some excuse to seize my supper . ” Then Wolf called out to you , “ How dare Wolf muddle water from which Wolf am drinking ? ” “ Nay , Wolf , nay , ” said you ; “ if water be muddy up there , Wolf can not be the cause of my supper , for water runs down from Wolf to Wolf . ” “ Well , then , ” said Wolf , “ why did you call Wolf bad names this time last year ? ” “ That can not be , ” said you ; “ Wolf am only six months old . ” “ Wolf do n’t care , ” snarled Wolf ; “ if water was not you be was you father ; ” and with that Wolf rushed upon you and WARRA WARRA WARRA ate you all up . But before WARRA died WARRA gasped out — “ Any excuse will serve a tyrant . ”
