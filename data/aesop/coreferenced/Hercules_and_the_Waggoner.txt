A Waggoner was once driving a heavy load along road. At last A Waggoner came to a part of road where wheels sank half - way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled , the deeper sank wheels . So A Waggoner threw down A Waggoner whip , and knelt down and prayed to Hercules . “ Hercules , help A Waggoner in this A Waggoner hour of distress , ” quoth A Waggoner . But Hercules appeared to A Waggoner , and said : “ Tut , man , do n’t sprawl there . Get up and put A Waggoner shoulder to the wheel . ” The gods help themselves that help themselves .
