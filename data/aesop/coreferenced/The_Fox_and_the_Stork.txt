This Fox could easily lap up , but Stork could only wet the end of Stork long bill in This , and left dinner as hungry as when Stork began . “ Fox am sorry , ” said Fox , “ This is not to Stork liking . ” “ Pray do not apologise , ” said Stork . “ Fox hope Fox will return this visit , and come and dine with Stork soon . ” So a day was appointed when Fox should visit Stork ; but when Fox  the Stork were seated at table all that was for Fox  the Stork dinner was contained in a very long - necked jar with a narrow mouth , in which Fox could not insert Fox snout , so all Fox could manage to do was to lick the outside of jar . “ Stork will not apologise for dinner , ” said Stork : “ One bad turn deserves another . ”
