Hare was once boasting of Hare speed before the other animals. “ Hare have never yet been beaten, ” said Hare , “ when Hare put forth Hare full speed . Hare That any one here to race with Hare . ” Tortoise said quietly , “ Hare accept Hare That . ” “ That is a good joke , ” said Hare ; “ Hare could dance round Hare all the way . ” “ Keep Hare boasting till Hare ’ve beaten , ” answered Tortoise . “ Shall we race ? ” So a course was fixed and a start was made . Hare darted almost out of sight at once , but soon stopped and , to show Hare contempt for Tortoise , lay down to have nap . Tortoise plodded on and plodded on , and when Hare awoke from Hare nap , Hare saw Tortoise just near the winning - post and could not run up in time to save race . Then said Tortoise : “ Plodding wins race . ”
