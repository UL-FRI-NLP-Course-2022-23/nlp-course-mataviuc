Once when Lion was asleep little Mouse began running up and down upon Lion; running soon wakened Lion, who placed Lion huge paw upon Lion , and opened Lion big jaws to swallow Lion . “ Pardon , Lion , ” cried little Mouse : “ forgive little Mouse running time , little Mouse shall never forget it : who knows but what little Mouse may be able to do Lion a turn some of these days ? ” Lion was so tickled at the idea of little Mouse being able to help Lion , that Lion lifted up Lion paw and let Lion go . Some time after Lion was caught in a trap , and the hunters who desired to carry Lion alive to the King , tied Lion to a tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry Lion on . Just then little Mouse happened to pass by , and seeing the sad plight in which Lion was , went up to Lion and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound Lion . “ Was little Mouse not right ? ” said little Mouse . Little friends may prove great friends .
