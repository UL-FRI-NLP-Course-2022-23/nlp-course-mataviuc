Now you must know growling  barking The Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to The Town Mouse cousin in country. The Town Mouse was rough and ready, you , but The Town Mouse loved The Town Mouse town friend and made you heartily welcome . Beans  bacon , cheese  bread , were all The Town Mouse had to offer , but The Town Mouse offered Beans  bacon , cheese  bread freely . The Town Mouse rather turned up The Town Mouse long nose at Beans  bacon , cheese  bread , and said : “ The Town Mouse can not understand , you , how you can put up with such poor food as Beans  bacon , cheese  bread , but of course you can not expect anything better in country ; come you with The Town Mouse and The Town Mouse will show you how to live . When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life . ” No sooner said than done : two mice set off for town and arrived at The Town Mouse residence late at night . “ you will want some refreshment after two mice long journey , ” said The Town Mouse , and took The Town Mouse friend into the grand dining - room . There two mice found the remains of a fine feast , and soon two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all growling  barking was nice . Suddenly two mice heard growling  barking . “ What is that ? ” said you . “ It is only the dogs of the house , ” answered you . “ Only ! ” said you . “ The Town Mouse do not like that music at you dinner . ” Just at that moment the door flew open , in came two huge mastiffs , and two mice had to scamper down and run off . “ Good - bye , you , ” said you . “ What ! going so soon ? ” said you . “ Yes , ” The Town Mouse replied ; “ Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear . ”
