me went once a - hunting along with Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf . They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised Stag , and soon took Stag life . Then came the question how spoil should be divided . “ Quarter me Stag , ” roared me ; so the other animals skinned Stag and cut Stag into four parts . Then me took me stand in front of the carcass and pronounced judgment : The first quarter is for me in me capacity as King of Beasts ; the second is me as arbiter ; another share comes to me for me part in the chase ; and as for fourth quarter , well , as for fourth quarter , me should like to see which of you will dare to lay a paw upon Stag . ” “ Humph , ” grumbled Fox as Fox walked away with me tail between Fox legs ; but Fox spoke in a low growl — “ you may share the labours of the great , but you will not share spoil . ”
