When first Fox saw Lion Fox was terribly frightened, and ran away and hid Fox in the wood. Next time however Fox came near Lion Fox stopped at a safe distance and watched Lion pass by . The third time they came near one another Fox went straight up to Lion and passed the time of day with Lion , asking Lion how Fox family were , and when Fox should have the pleasure of seeing Lion again ; then turning Fox tail , Fox parted from Lion without much ceremony . Familiarity breeds contempt .
