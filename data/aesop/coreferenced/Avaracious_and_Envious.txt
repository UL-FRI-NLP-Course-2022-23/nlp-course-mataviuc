Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed Jupiter to grant Two neighbours hearts â€™ desire. Now The Avaricious man was full of avarice, and the other eaten up with envy . So to punish Two neighbours , Jupiter granted that each might have whatever each wished for each , but only on condition that each neighbour had twice as much . The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold . No sooner said than done ; but all each joy was turned to grief when each found that The Avaricious man neighbour had two rooms full of gold . Then came the turn of the Envious man , who could not bear to think that The Avaricious man neighbour had any joy at all . So The Avaricious man prayed that The Avaricious man might have one of The Avaricious man own eyes put out , by which means The Avaricious man companion would become totally blind . Vices are Two neighbours own punishment .
