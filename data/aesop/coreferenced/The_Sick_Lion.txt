Lion had come to the end of Lion days and lay sick unto death at the mouth of Lion cave, gasping for breath. The animals , Lion subjects , came round Lion and drew nearer as Lion grew more and more helpless . When themselves saw Lion on the point of death themselves thought to themselves : “ Now is the time to pay off old grudges . ” So Boar came up and drove at Lion with Lion tusks ; then Bull gored Lion with Lion horns ; still Lion lay helpless before themselves : so Ass , feeling quite safe from danger , came up , and turning Lion tail to Lion kicked up Lion heels into Lion face . “ This is a double death , ” growled Lion . Only cowards insult dying majesty .
