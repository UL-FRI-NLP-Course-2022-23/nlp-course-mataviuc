All fled at An Ass approach , both men and animals , and An Ass was a proud Ass that day . In An Ass delight An Ass lifted up An Ass voice and brayed , but then every one knew An Ass , and An Ass owner came up and gave An Ass a sound cudgelling for the fright An Ass had caused . And shortly afterwards Fox came up to An Ass and said : “ Ah , Fox knew An Ass by An Ass voice . ” Fine clothes may disguise , but silly words will disclose a fool .
