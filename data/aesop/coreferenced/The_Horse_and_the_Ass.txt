Horse and Ass were travelling together, Horse prancing along in Horse fine trappings, Ass carrying with difficulty the heavy weight in Horse panniers . “ Ass wish Ass were you , ” sighed Ass ; “ nothing to do and well fed , and all that fine harness upon you . ” Next day , however , there was day , and Horse was wounded to death in the final charge of day . Horse friend , Ass , happened to pass by shortly afterwards and found Horse on the point of death . “ Ass was wrong , ” said Ass : “ Better humble security than gilded danger . ”
