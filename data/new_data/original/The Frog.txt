Once upon a time, there was a group of frogs living in a small pond. One day, a group of young frogs challenged the older, wiser frogs to a jumping competition. The young frogs boasted about how high they could jump, and challenged the older frogs to do the same.

The competition began, and one by one, the young frogs jumped as high as they could. The older frogs watched, and when it was their turn, they simply stood in place. Confused, the young frogs asked why they weren't jumping.

One of the older frogs replied, "We have already jumped as high as we needed to. We have learned through experience that jumping recklessly can be dangerous and can lead to injury. It's not about who can jump the highest, but about knowing when to jump and when not to.
