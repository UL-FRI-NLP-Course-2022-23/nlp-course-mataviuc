Once upon a time, a hungry fox saw a bunch of grapes hanging from a vine. The fox tried to reach the grapes, but they were too high for him. He jumped and jumped, but he couldn't reach them. Finally, the fox gave up and walked away, saying that the grapes were probably sour anyway. The fox was too proud to admit that he couldn't get what he wanted.Once upon a time, a hungry fox saw a bunch of grapes hanging from a vine.
