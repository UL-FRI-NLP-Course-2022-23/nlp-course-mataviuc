Once upon a time, a Tortoise and a Hare decided to have a race. The Hare was very fast and confident, while the Tortoise was slow and steady. The Hare ran so fast that he soon got ahead of the Tortoise and decided to take a nap under a tree. When he woke up, he found that the Tortoise had passed him and was close to the finish line. The Hare ran as fast as he could, but he was too late. The Tortoise won the race. The moral of the story is "slow and steady wins the race."
