Once upon a time, a Lion was sleeping in the forest. A little Mouse ran across his paw and woke him up. The Lion was angry and raised his paw to crush the Mouse, but the Mouse begged for mercy and promised to help the Lion in the future. The Lion laughed at the idea of a tiny Mouse helping him, but he let the Mouse go. Later, the Lion got caught in a hunter's trap, and he couldn't escape. The Mouse heard the Lion's roar and ran to help him. The Mouse gnawed at the ropes until the Lion was free. The Lion learned that even the smallest creature can be a big help.
