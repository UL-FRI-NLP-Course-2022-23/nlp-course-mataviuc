Once upon a time, a mother duck laid some eggs. When the eggs hatched, all the ducklings were cute and fluffy except for one. The other ducklings teased the ugly one and made it feel bad. The ugly duckling felt so bad that it ran away. Eventually, the ugly duckling found some swans and was amazed by their beauty. The swans welcomed the duckling, and when it looked at its reflection in the water, it saw that it had transformed into a beautiful swan.
