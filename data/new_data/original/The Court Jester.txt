Once upon a time, in a grand castle, there lived a king who was known for his wisdom. The king had a court jester who loved to tell jokes and make the king laugh. The jester would often play pranks on the other courtiers, which sometimes caused trouble.

One day, the jester played a prank on the king himself, and the king was not amused. The jester was worried that he might be punished, but instead of punishing him, the king decided to teach him a lesson.

The king gave the jester a task to perform. He asked him to find a way to make him laugh without telling a single joke. The jester was puzzled but took on the challenge.

Days went by, and the jester tried every possible thing to make the king laugh, but nothing worked. Finally, he decided to try something unusual. He dressed up as the king himself and entered the throne room. As soon as the king saw him, he burst out laughing.

The king was impressed with the jester's creativity and rewarded him with a bag of gold coins. The jester learned that sometimes it's better to think outside the box and be creative to achieve success.
