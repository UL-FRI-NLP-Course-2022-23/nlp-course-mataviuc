Once upon a time, there was a hungry rabbit who was searching for food. He saw a beautiful garden full of carrots and could not resist the temptation to try one.

The rabbit sneaked into the garden and found a juicy carrot. He was about to take a bite when he heard a voice saying, "Stop! That carrot is not yours!"

The rabbit turned around and saw a scarecrow guarding the garden. The scarecrow warned the rabbit that if he took the carrot, he would be in trouble.

The rabbit ignored the scarecrow's warning and took a big bite of the carrot. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his mouth. The carrot had been coated with a bitter-tasting substance to keep animals away.

The rabbit regretted his decision to steal the carrot and ran away from the garden, feeling sick and guilty.

From that day on, the rabbit learned to be patient and wait for things that were rightfully his, instead of trying to take them by force.
