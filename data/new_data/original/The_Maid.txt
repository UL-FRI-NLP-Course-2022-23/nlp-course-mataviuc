Once upon a time, there was a wealthy family who hired a maid to help them with their daily chores. The maid was hardworking and efficient, and soon became a trusted member of the household.

One day, the family's young daughter lost her favorite toy and was inconsolable. The maid, feeling sorry for the girl, decided to go out and buy her a new toy. She used her own money to purchase the toy and gave it to the girl, who was overjoyed.

When the family found out what the maid had done, they were touched by her kindness and generosity. They decided to give her a raise and even offered to pay for the toy she had bought for their daughter.

From that day on, the maid continued to work diligently for the family, and they treated her with the respect and appreciation she deserved.
