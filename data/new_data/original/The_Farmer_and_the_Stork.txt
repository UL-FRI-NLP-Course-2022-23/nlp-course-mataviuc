Once upon a time, a farmer set a trap to catch cranes that were eating his crops. A stork got caught in the trap, and the farmer decided to punish him as well. He cut off the stork's legs and left him to die. Later, when the farmer was visited by a group of storks, they asked him where their friend was. The farmer replied that he didn't know him and that he never had any visitors with long legs. The storks understood the farmer's deceit and flew away. The farmer learned a valuable lesson: it's never wise to deceive others.
