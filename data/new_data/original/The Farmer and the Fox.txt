Once upon a time, a Farmer had a hen that laid a golden egg every day. One day, a cunning Fox saw the Farmer carrying the golden egg and came up with a plan to steal it.

The Fox approached the Farmer and said, "Good day, sir. That must be a very special hen to lay golden eggs. Would you like to trade it for something of equal value?"

The Farmer thought about it for a moment and agreed to the Fox's proposal. However, when the Fox took the hen, it realized it had been tricked. The hen didn't lay golden eggs after all, and now the Fox had nothing to trade.
