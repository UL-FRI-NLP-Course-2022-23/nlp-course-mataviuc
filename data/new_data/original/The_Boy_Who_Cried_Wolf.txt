Once upon a time, a young shepherd boy was tending his sheep. He got bored and thought it would be funny to trick the villagers by crying out, "Wolf! Wolf!" The villagers came running to help, but there was no wolf. The boy laughed and did this several times. One day, a wolf actually appeared, and the boy cried out for help, but the villagers thought he was lying again and didn't come to help. The wolf attacked and killed some of the sheep. The boy learned a lesson about the importance of telling the truth.
