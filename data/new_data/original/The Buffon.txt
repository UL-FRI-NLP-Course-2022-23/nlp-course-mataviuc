Once upon a time, a buffoon came to a village and started performing his tricks. He was very funny and soon became popular among the villagers. One day, the village chief invited the buffoon to his house for dinner. During the meal, the buffoon was served a bowl of hot soup. The buffoon thought it would be funny to play a trick on the chief and pretended to burn his mouth with the soup, even though it was not very hot.

The chief was not amused and scolded the buffoon for his childish behavior. The buffoon realized his mistake and apologized to the chief. From that day on, the buffoon stopped playing tricks and started performing his acts with more maturity and professionalism. The villagers were impressed and the buffoon became even more popular than before.
