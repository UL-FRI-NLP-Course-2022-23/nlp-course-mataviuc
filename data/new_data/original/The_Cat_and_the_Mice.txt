Once upon a time, a cat caught a group of mice and was about to eat them all. One of the mice pleaded with the cat to let them go, saying that they would be grateful and repay the favor someday. The cat was amused and let the mice go, thinking it was a ridiculous idea. However, the mice did repay the favor by gnawing through the ropes that bound the cat when he was later caught by a hunter. The cat learned a valuable lesson: even the smallest creature can have a big heart.
