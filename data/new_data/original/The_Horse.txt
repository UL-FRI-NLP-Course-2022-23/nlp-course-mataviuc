Once upon a time, there was a hardworking horse who belonged to a farmer. The horse spent its days plowing the fields and carrying heavy loads. One day, the horse grew tired of working so hard and wished to be free. The horse decided to run away, but before it could make its escape, the farmer caught it and scolded it for wanting to leave. The horse explained its feelings to the farmer, and to the horse's surprise, the farmer understood. From that day forward, the farmer treated the horse with kindness and gave it plenty of rest and freedom. The horse was grateful and continued to work hard, knowing that it was appreciated.
