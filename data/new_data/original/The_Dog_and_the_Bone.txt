Once upon a time, a dog found a bone in the forest and was very proud of it. As he crossed a bridge over a river, he looked down and saw his reflection in the water. He thought he saw another dog with a bigger bone, and out of greed, he dropped his own bone and jumped in the water to get the other dog's bone. But there was no other dog, and he lost his own bone in the river. The dog learned a valuable lesson: it's better to be content with what you have than to lose it all by being greedy.
