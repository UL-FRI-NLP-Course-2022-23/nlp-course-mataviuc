Once upon a time, a dog was walking with a bone in its mouth. It saw its reflection in a river and thought that it was another dog with a bone. The dog became greedy and thought it could get two bones by taking the other dog's bone. It opened its mouth to bark, and the bone fell into the water. The dog realized its mistake and regretted its greed.
