One day, the rabbit was bragging about how fast he was to all the animals in the forest. The tortoise, who was tired of hearing the rabbit boast, challenged him to a race. The rabbit accepted the challenge, thinking it would be an easy win.

On the day of the race, the rabbit took off quickly, leaving the tortoise far behind. Feeling confident, the rabbit decided to take a nap under a tree. Meanwhile, the tortoise continued to plod along steadily. When the rabbit woke up, he was surprised to find that the tortoise was almost at the finish line. He ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise won the race.
