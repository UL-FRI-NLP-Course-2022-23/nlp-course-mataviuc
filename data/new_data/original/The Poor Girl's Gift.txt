There was once a poor girl who lived in a small village. She had nothing but a kind heart and a desire to help others. One day, a rich merchant came to the village and offered a reward to anyone who could solve a difficult riddle. The poor girl was intrigued and decided to try her luck.

She went to the merchant and asked to hear the riddle. The merchant said, "What is greater than God, more evil than the devil, the poor have it, the rich need it, and if you eat it, you will die?" The poor girl thought long and hard but could not come up with an answer.

The next day, she went to the merchant and said, "I do not know the answer to your riddle, but I have a gift for you." She gave him a small box and said, "Please open this when you are feeling sad or discouraged."

The merchant was puzzled but took the box and the poor girl's gift. When he opened the box, he found a small note that read, "This too shall pass." The merchant was touched by the poor girl's kindness and realized that even though he was wealthy, he needed to be reminded that nothing in life lasts forever.

From that day forward, the merchant became more compassionate and generous to others. And the poor girl, although still poor, felt rich in her heart knowing that she had made a difference in someone's life.
