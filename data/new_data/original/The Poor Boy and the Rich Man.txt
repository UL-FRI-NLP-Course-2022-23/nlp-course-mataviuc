Once upon a time, a poor boy asked a rich man how he became so wealthy. The rich man said he had worked hard and made smart investments. The poor boy asked the rich man to teach him how to invest, but the rich man refused, saying that the poor boy would never be able to understand such complex matters. The poor boy went away sad, but he didn't give up. He worked hard and saved every penny he earned. Eventually, he became successful and even richer than the man who had once refused to teach him. The poor boy learned a valuable lesson: hard work and perseverance can pay off.
