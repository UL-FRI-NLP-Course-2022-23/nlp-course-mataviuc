Once upon a time, there was a donkey who was tired of carrying heavy loads. One day, he saw a wild horse galloping in a field and became envious of its freedom. The donkey thought that if he could only be a horse, he would be able to enjoy life too.

So the donkey went to a witch and asked her to turn him into a horse. The witch asked the donkey what he would give her in return, and the donkey promised to do anything she asked.

The witch granted the donkey's wish and turned him into a horse. The donkey was thrilled and ran off into the field, enjoying his new life as a horse.

However, soon the donkey realized that he was not really a horse. He did not have the speed or strength of a true horse, and he missed his old life as a donkey.

One day, the witch came to the donkey and asked him to carry a load for her. The donkey realized that he could not refuse her request since he had promised to do anything in return for being turned into a horse. So the donkey carried the load for the witch.

From that day on, the donkey learned to be content with his old life and never again wished to be something he was not.
