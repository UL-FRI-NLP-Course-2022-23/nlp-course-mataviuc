Once upon a time, a proud peacock saw a crane and said, "You are so dull and plain. Look at me with my bright colors and beautiful feathers!" The crane replied, "Yes, but I can fly high up into the sky and reach places you can only dream of." The peacock laughed and said, "Flying is nothing compared to my beauty." However, a hunter came to the area and caught the peacock. The crane was able to fly away and escape. The peacock learned that beauty is not everything and that one should also value practical skills.
