Once upon a time, three little pigs decided to build their houses. The first pig built his house of straw, the second pig built his house of sticks, and the third pig built his house of bricks. One day, a hungry wolf came to the area and saw the houses. He first tried to enter the straw house but blew it down easily. He then tried to enter the stick house but also blew it down easily. However, when he tried to enter the brick house, he failed to do so. The pigs were able to outsmart the wolf and live happily ever after.
