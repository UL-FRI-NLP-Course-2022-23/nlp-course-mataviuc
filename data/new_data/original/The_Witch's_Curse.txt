Once upon a time, a young girl got lost in the woods and stumbled upon a witch's hut. The witch agreed to help the girl find her way home but only if the girl would complete three tasks. The girl completed the tasks, but the witch tricked her and put a curse on her that caused her to fall into a deep sleep. The girl's family searched for her and eventually found the witch's hut. They confronted the witch and broke the curse. The witch learned a valuable lesson: dishonesty and trickery can lead to trouble.
