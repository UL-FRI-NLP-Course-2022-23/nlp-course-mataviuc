Once upon a time, there were two characters, an Ant and a Grasshopper, who lived in a field. The Ant worked hard all summer, gathering food for the winter, while the Grasshopper played and enjoyed the sun. When winter came, the Ant had plenty of food to eat, but the Grasshopper had nothing. The Grasshopper begged the Ant for food, but the Ant replied, "Why should I give you food now when you wasted your time all summer?" The Grasshopper learned his lesson and vowed to work hard from then on.
