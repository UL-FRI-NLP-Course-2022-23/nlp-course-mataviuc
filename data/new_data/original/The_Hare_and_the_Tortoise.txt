Once upon a time, a hare bragged about his speed and challenged a tortoise to a race. The tortoise accepted, and they began the race. The hare soon took the lead and, feeling confident, decided to take a nap. The tortoise continued to move steadily forward and eventually crossed the finish line before the hare woke up. The hare learned a valuable lesson: slow and steady wins the race.
