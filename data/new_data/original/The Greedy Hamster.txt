Once upon a time, there was a hamster who loved to eat. Every day, he would stuff his cheeks with as much food as he could find, not leaving anything for anyone else. One day, the hamster found a huge stash of food and was so greedy that he ate everything in sight. However, the food was old and moldy, and the hamster soon became very sick. He realized that his greed had led him to make a bad decision, and he learned to be more mindful of his actions.
